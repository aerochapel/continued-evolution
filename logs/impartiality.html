            <p>It’s not uncommon to hear people dismiss the Bible on the grounds that it was “written by men.” For some, this fact alone is enough to discredit its validity entirely. The reasoning goes that men are flawed and imperfect, and therefore unworthy of producing something that holds ultimate truth. Yet when I hear this, I can’t help but wonder: is the source of something the only measure of its value? Or should we, instead, examine its ideas, concepts, and the profound impact it can have on our lives?</p><p>When I read the Bible, I don’t see the imperfections of men in its pages. I see wisdom, beauty, and transformative ideas. The teachings of love, forgiveness, sacrifice, and redemption transcend the human hands that wrote them down. To judge the Bible solely by its authorship is to miss its essence entirely. Instead of asking, <strong>“Who wrote this?”</strong> we should ask, <strong>“What does this mean for me? What truth does it reveal?”</strong></p><h3 id="creation-in-a-technological-world">Creation in a Technological World</h3><p>This perspective becomes increasingly important as we navigate a world transformed by artificial intelligence. With AI now capable of creating images, writing essays, and composing music, people are quick to question the authenticity of what they see. <strong>“Did you create that? Or was it AI?”</strong> they ask, as though the method of creation invalidates the creation itself.</p><p>But does it really matter who—or what—produced something, as long as the idea behind it resonates, inspires, or enlightens?</p><p>In a world saturated with technology, it is not the creator but the essence of the creation that will define its value. Whether a piece of art was painted by a person or generated by an algorithm should not diminish the power of the image itself. What matters is the concept it conveys, the emotions it stirs, and the truths it reveals.</p><p>Similarly, the Bible should not be judged merely on the fact that men wrote it, but on the eternal wisdom and spiritual insights it offers.</p><h3 id="the-call-for-impartiality">The Call for Impartiality</h3><p>This shift in thinking requires impartiality—a willingness to set aside questions of craft and focus on content. We must look beyond superficial markers of authenticity, whether it’s the brushstroke of an artist or the human hand behind a story, and instead ask: <strong>“What is this trying to tell me? Does this idea make me better, wiser, or more compassionate?”</strong></p><p>Consider, for example, a painting of Christ. Is it important whether it was painted by a master of the Renaissance or generated by a computer? Or is its true value in the way it invites us to reflect on Christ’s love, sacrifice, and teachings?</p><p>The essence of the image, the story it conveys, and the meaning it brings to our lives are what truly matter.</p><h3 id="faith-beyond-origins">Faith Beyond Origins</h3><p>In a similar way, our faith in Christ should not rest solely on debates over miracles or supernatural claims. Instead, we are called to focus on who Christ is, what He stands for, and the message He brought to humanity.</p><p>His teachings of love, humility, and redemption are timeless truths that don’t rely on proofs or explanations. To believe in Christ is to embrace His essence, His ideas, and His transformative impact on our lives—not to fixate on the details of how those ideas came to us.</p><h3 id="a-new-lens-for-judgment">A New Lens for Judgment</h3><p>We live in an age where ideas and concepts are the backbone of communication and judgment. Whether they come from a person, a machine, or the pages of an ancient text, their value lies in their power to enlighten and transform. By focusing on the essence of what we encounter, rather than the method of its creation, we can navigate reality with greater clarity and purpose.</p><p>Let us approach life, art, and faith with open minds and hearts. Let us look beyond the craft to see the meaning, the truth, and the beauty within. And let us remember that what matters most is not where something comes from, but what it can teach us, how it can move us, and the light it brings to our lives.</p>
