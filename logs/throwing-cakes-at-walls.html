    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">9 May 2025</p>
    
    <p>I was speaking with a friend recently, and he described something that struck me. He had met someone who, in person, was warm, expressive, and highly engaged—someone who came alive in conversation. But once they started communicating digitally, the energy vanished. Their messages were flat, brief, and emotionally vacant. It felt like an entirely different person.</p>
  
    <p>That moment revealed something bigger. There’s a widening gap between how people present themselves physically and how they show up digitally. Many still treat face-to-face interaction as the only space where authenticity counts. But in 2025, with an abundance of expressive tools—voice messages, video calls, real-time captions, text-to-speech—this is no longer a practical limitation. It’s a choice.</p>
  
    <p>And more than that, it’s a kind of quiet refusal. We have the capacity now to engage with each other meaningfully across distance. You can walk through your home, cook a meal, or take a train and still have a rich, spontaneous conversation—just as people once poured themselves into handwritten letters. The film <em>Her</em> once portrayed that future as fiction: a man reclining in a chair, speaking into the air, forming an emotional bond with an AI voice. But today, that experience isn’t science fiction—it’s an unused feature on your phone.</p>
  
    <p>And yet, most people still won’t send a voice note.</p>
  
    <p>This refusal isn't just a missed opportunity. It’s part of a larger pattern—what I call <strong>evolutionary hurdling</strong>: the tendency to leap over the necessary stages of adaptation and understanding, racing ahead into new technologies without first learning how to use the existing ones well. We skip the moral, social, and cognitive groundwork. We don't ask what these tools are <em>for</em>—we just adopt them, discard them, and move on.</p>
  
    <p>We’re now hurtling toward artificial intelligence—systems that will speak for us, think for us, even feel for us—before we’ve learned how to represent ourselves consistently as human beings across mediums. If someone’s digital presence is fragmented, vague, or absent, they’re not just hard to reach—they’re signaling something deeper: that their identity is conditional, dependent on context, and ultimately unstable.</p>
  
    <p>And this contradiction shows up everywhere. People say they’d rather “wait to meet in person,” as though that’s the only setting where meaning can occur. But these same people will work for international companies, consume media from across the world, buy products made by hands they'll never shake, travel to foreign countries, follow wars, donate to global causes. They live in a world built on remote engagement—economically, politically, culturally—<em>yet they resist being emotionally available to someone ten miles down the road over a phone call</em>. That’s how disjointed we’ve become. The emotional convenience of distance is accepted when it's transactional—but rejected when it's personal.</p>
  
    <p>You can’t have it both ways. If you benefit from a global world, you’re part of it. And if you’re part of it, then digital communication isn't a lesser substitute—it’s the connective tissue. You can’t claim to value people while refusing to meet them where they are.</p>
  
    <p>And besides, the idea that physical interaction is inherently more authentic than digital one is nonsense. I spent 24 years living in the UK, a culture where social interactions are often riddled with coded language and polite avoidance. There’s even a spreadsheet circulating online that decodes common British phrases: “That’s interesting” often means “You’re a fool”; “Let’s catch up next week” usually means “I never want to see you again.” This isn’t a critique—it’s a reflection of the social double-speak embedded in physical interaction. In many ways, it’s <em>more</em> performative than digital communication, not less.</p>
  
    <p>People can use eye contact, body language, and vocal tone to create the illusion of sincerity. But does it matter if the content is hollow? Is it really more “real” to smile and nod while saying something you don’t mean? A typed sentence that carries thought and care can hold far more weight than a perfectly timed laugh. We aren’t animals limited to grunts and gestures—we have language, nuance, tools, memory. We’ve always been capable of expressing ourselves across distance. We wrote letters across continents and oceans long before video calls.</p>
  
    <p>And here’s something I’ve seen over and over again: people will join WhatsApp groups, spend months in radio silence, and then the moment someone leaves the group—<em>that</em> sparks more curiosity than any interaction ever did. I’ve spent years in these groups. Most of the time, the conversations are either superficial or non-existent. People are unwilling to engage. And yet, the single most expressive act becomes <em>leaving</em> the group. That’s when people finally speak up. That’s when they wonder why. As if the lack of engagement leading up to that moment wasn’t reason enough. It’s absurd, but it tells you everything about the state of communication: silence is normal, but leaving is newsworthy.</p>
  
    <p>Meanwhile, people who won’t respond to a personal message are often the same ones posting heavily filtered pieces of their lives on Instagram or sharing long rants on Facebook. They claim to be private, yet perform for strangers. They post vacations, birthdays, and political opinions—but ignore the human beings actually trying to reach them.</p>
  
    <p>And then there’s the flip side. People who are vocal and expressive online but entirely subdued in person. The ones who vent frustrations on Reddit during their lunch breaks but return to office pleasantries and social niceties by 2 p.m. You start to realize we’re living in a split system: online selves and offline selves, rarely aligned, rarely accountable to one another.</p>
  
    <p>That’s the real issue—<em>consistency</em>. Personally, I’ve always tried to remain the same in person and online, because any other way makes no sense. Why fragment yourself? Why split into two beings? The same tone, the same ideas, the same values should carry through. That’s not just integrity—it’s sanity.</p>
  
    <p>But now, as we teeter on the edge of a new frontier—AI systems that can mimic our tone, synthesize our speech, and automate our conversations—we risk becoming spectators in our own relationships. We’re building powerful tools that replicate our intelligence, but we’re doing nothing to maintain it. It’s like living in a world where robots can lift 500 kilograms, but you refuse to train your muscles. Eventually, you become obsolete—not because the technology is too powerful, but because you never adapted alongside it.</p>
  
    <p>And so we arrive at a cultural crossroads. Digital communication was supposed to bring us closer. Instead, we’ve turned it into a filtering mechanism—a place to curate identity, manage status, and minimize effort. Platforms that once promised connection now train us in detachment. A simple voice note—arguably more human than a text—is avoided not because it’s ineffective, but because it requires vulnerability. Presence. The risk of being <em>heard</em>.</p>
  
    <p>And here lies the irony. The people who avoid real digital connection are often the ones most visibly expressive on social media. Or they’re the ones who will, in the coming years, turn most eagerly to AI companions—not because they prefer machines, but because they never learned how to be fully present with real people in digital spaces. When every reply sounds the same, and AI can mimic warmth better than your friends, who you’re talking to becomes irrelevant. It's not that we’ll stop talking to people. It’s that we won’t be able to tell—or care—when we’re not.</p>
  
    <p>This isn’t just a social shift. It’s an existential one. We are building tools meant to reflect us, yet we hesitate to fully inhabit the spaces where those tools live. And the result is a kind of quiet surrender. The more we avoid expressing ourselves authentically across distance, the more likely we are to be replaced by something that can.</p>
  
    <p>We don’t need more connection—we need more commitment to it. The tools are already here. What’s missing is the courage to use them like we mean it.</p>
  
    <p>As we move further into the age of AI, we have to decide what it’s for. AI should not replace depth—it should reveal it. It should act as a lens to help us express what we find difficult to say, not a mask that speaks in our place. It should help us bring <em>more</em> of ourselves into our relationships—not less. If used wisely, it can support our humanity. But if we let it do the work we’ve abandoned, it will quietly erase us.</p>
