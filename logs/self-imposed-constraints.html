            <h3 id="self-imposed-constraints">Self-Imposed Constraints</h3><p><strong><em>"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."</em></strong><br>— Matthew 7:13-14 (NIV)</p><p>I’ve come to realize that creativity flourishes not in boundless freedom but within self-imposed constraints.</p><p>It’s a lesson I learned while working in design. At first, the blank canvas felt like infinite possibility – a sprawling landscape where anything could be created. But as I worked, I discovered that the more I narrowed the parameters – limiting typefaces, restricting color palettes, and defining strict grid systems – the more innovative and refined the results became.</p><p>This paradox of limitation enhancing creativity mirrors what happens when you walk in faith.</p><h3 id="narrowing-the-gate">Narrowing the Gate</h3><p>When you step into life with Christ, you choose to narrow the gate. It’s a reduction, in some ways – a shedding of excess paths and distractions. Whether it’s following the Ten Commandments, practicing discipline, or surrendering certain desires, the path becomes less about the abundance of choice and more about depth within a defined framework.</p><p>At first glance, these constraints might seem restrictive. But they offer a kind of freedom that endless options never can.</p><p>When there are too many paths, too many choices, it’s easy to become paralyzed by indecision. Life begins to feel like scrolling through endless channels on TV, finding nothing that holds your attention. But when the paths are narrowed, you begin to move forward with clarity and purpose.</p><h3 id="liberation-through-structure">Liberation Through Structure</h3><p>There’s something profoundly liberating about living within a framework that sustains growth. The constraints aren’t barriers; they are guides – pointing you consistently in the right direction. Just as creative boundaries in design lead to more elegant solutions, the boundaries of faith focus your energy and intention, allowing you to go further, faster.</p><p>It’s not about limitation for the sake of suffering but about creating a path that avoids unnecessary resistance.</p><p>When the gate is narrow, there’s less noise. Less distraction. Less weight to carry. What remains is the pure essence of the journey – one that leads directly to life.</p><h3 id="efficiency-in-growth">Efficiency in Growth</h3><p>In creativity, narrowing the tools forces you to master them. You explore each element fully, squeezing meaning and beauty from even the simplest shapes. In faith, narrowing your path forces you to grow deeply rather than widely.</p><p>This refinement cultivates sustainability – a long-term trajectory that builds layer upon layer, allowing you to fully embody the framework of Christ’s teachings. The fewer directions you pull, the stronger your foundation becomes.</p><h3 id="the-path-of-less-resistance">The Path of Less Resistance</h3><p>Living without constraints often creates more resistance, not less. The open gate may seem attractive, but it invites distraction, temptation, and detours that exhaust and delay. The narrow gate, however, eliminates the unnecessary and keeps you moving forward.</p><p>By choosing constraints, you are not limiting potential – you are concentrating it.</p><h3 id="the-freedom-of-focus">The Freedom of Focus</h3><p>The beauty of this narrow path is that it leads to abundance in the places that matter most. It focuses on quality over quantity, depth over breadth. What initially feels like restriction soon reveals itself as the most liberating way to live.</p><p>In design, in creativity, and in faith, it is often the self-imposed constraints that lead to the greatest expressions of beauty and fulfillment.</p>
