    <p>There’s a kind of wound that doesn’t bleed. It doesn’t scream. It just lingers—shaping how you see everything that comes after. For a child of divorce, especially one who thrives on structure, order, and clarity, that wound is not just emotional. It’s existential.</p>
    <p>We often talk about the effects of divorce on children in general terms—emotional instability, trust issues, attachment patterns. But for a child who’s wired to think conceptually and analytically, who wants the world to make sense, who seeks stability and long-term meaning, that fracture is far more catastrophic. It’s not just the breaking of a family—it’s the collapse of an entire reality.</p>
    <p>I was one of those kids. For me, my parents' separation wasn’t just a change in living arrangements. It was a forced introduction to chaos. A system that had once provided certainty, consistency, and a kind of invisible architecture for life suddenly revealed itself to be fragile—built on assumptions, held together by routine, and undone by time and disconnection. And when that happened, it didn’t just make me question love. It made me question everything.</p>
    <p>What followed wasn’t just grief—it was a kind of awakening. I began to see through things. Through small talk. Through social pleasantries. Through the fabric of polite conversation that people call connection. I started to notice how much of adult interaction is performative empathy—a well-rehearsed exchange to meet mutual ends. Whether in business or friendship or family gatherings, I began to sense that much of it was ritual, not real intimacy.</p>
    <p>It was like realizing Santa Claus isn't real—but on a societal level. The family unit, the roles we play, the idea of unconditional love—none of it felt safe anymore. And once you see that, you can’t unsee it. You begin to scan the world not for comfort, but for authenticity. Not for tradition, but for truth. You search for people who aren't pretending. Situations that don’t rely on scripts. Realness.</p>
    <p>That loss of foundational certainty pushed me to build my own systems. I began creating my own structures—projects, ideas, frameworks—anything that could bring a sense of logic and order to the disorder I’d internalized. That’s how I survived: not by mirroring the world, but by redesigning it. And for all its pain, that became my strength.</p>
    <p>But it also came with a cost. When your first model of love collapses, it’s like being handed a new dictionary. Words like “home,” “security,” “together,” and “forever” are quietly redefined. You don’t know who rewrote them, but you have to learn their new meanings. You stop expecting permanence. You learn to navigate islands instead of continents—fragmented relationships instead of unified ones.</p>
    <p>Now, as a millennial, that fracture feels even more amplified. We were born into the analog world, but had to grow up in a digital one. We didn’t just experience family breakdown—we transitioned between entire cultural realities. From face-to-face to screen-to-screen. From community to individualism. From stable institutions to algorithms and trends. Add to that the instability of housing, careers, and a world teetering between old values and new demands, and it’s no wonder many of us feel unmoored.</p>
    <p>And yet, in the middle of all that loss, something valuable was born. A kind of radical self-reliance. A hunger for truth. A refusal to accept the surface of things. When you’ve had the rug pulled out from under you early, you learn not to rely on the rug. You learn to build your own ground.</p>
    <p>Still, there’s a part of you that mourns what could have been. A version of life where “home” meant one roof. Where “love” meant unity. Where “family” was a single table, not a series of separate visits and navigated tensions. A world where the foundations held.</p>
    <p>This isn’t about blame. It’s about acknowledgment. That for some of us, the chaos of divorce wasn’t just painful—it was formative. It taught us to question everything. To see through the noise. To build our own meaning. And it taught us, above all, that authenticity is sacred.</p>
    <p>Because when you’ve lost the map, you start making your own. And maybe that’s how you begin again.</p>
