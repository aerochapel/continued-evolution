    <p>There’s something revealing — almost diagnostic — about the way England reacts to Meghan Markle and the way half of America reacts to Donald Trump. They’ve become more than public figures. They’re not politicians or royals anymore, not really. They’re metrics. Measurements of unhappiness. Markers of the emotional entropy in two of the most developed nations on Earth.</p>
  
    <p>Let’s call it the MegTrick — a phenomenon where a figure becomes famous not for being widely admired, but for being widely hated. Where the collective disdain of a nation fuels the very prominence of the person they claim to reject. It’s a psychological trap, and it works because both England and America, in their own ways, have progressed to such levels of abstraction — so high up the tower of modernity and late-stage capitalism — that they can’t see the ground anymore.</p>
  
    <p>With no spiritual foundation to fall back on, no common culture to stabilize identity, and no sense of community strong enough to absorb individual pain, that pain needs a target. In a more Christian era, people would have handed their suffering to God, or to the community, or to family. Now, they hand it to Meghan. Or to Donald. They take personal dissatisfaction and outsource it to a symbol.</p>
  
    <p>And here's the irony: I’m not even a critic of Trump. Politically, I think he’s necessary. Visionary, even. But his existence in American consciousness isn’t measured by policy — it’s measured by polarity. Just like Meghan’s isn’t measured by grace or leadership but by endless debates over her character, her intentions, her place. These two figures are lightning rods for societies that no longer know how to self-regulate their emotions or reconcile their privileges.</p>
  
    <p>It’s worth emphasizing: Meghan Markle isn’t popular because she’s competent. She’s prominent because millions of people can’t stop talking about how incompetent they think she is. And that’s the MegTrick. The more people try to tear her down, the more relevant she becomes. She’s been branded by hatred, but that brand is still a brand. That feedback loop only works in a society where attention — even negative attention — is currency.</p>
  
    <p>And once the machinery behind her — the think tanks, the strategists, the Netflix deals — realize that hatred keeps her name alive, they’ll lean into it. They already have. If they’ve got the lack of self-awareness to release something like Harry & Meghan or Meghan: We Love Her — if that’s even the real title — they’ll absolutely keep turning her into a self-referential parody. Victimhood becomes strategy. Relevance is sustained by contempt.</p>
  
    <p>Trump’s case is more tragic in a way. Because while Meghan is static and thrives on static, Trump has actually evolved. His political instincts have sharpened, his worldview has matured — but none of that matters to the half of the country still imprisoned by the perception the media cemented during his first presidency. The idea of Trump — the meme, the monster, the brand — is now more influential than the man himself. Meghan’s team amplifies the narrative for relevance. Trump fights it, and loses to the ghost of himself.</p>
  
    <p>So when you see someone like Meghan Markle dominating headlines in the UK, or Trump dominating them in the US, it’s not just about them. It’s about the country itself. These people are barometers. Their fame is directly proportional to how fragmented and unhappy the culture has become. A healthy society ignores what doesn’t serve it. A sick one obsesses.</p>
  
    <p>But there’s a broader scope to all of this — a deeper distortion at play. What we’re really seeing isn’t just a political or cultural phenomenon. It’s a civilizational one. The world itself has inverted. We now live in a system where the more you develop yourself with authenticity — through wisdom, discipline, intelligence, or quiet meaning — the more you are pushed to the fringe. Meanwhile, the more controversy you generate, the more inane your behavior, the more visibility you’re granted. Meghan Markle transferring pretzels from one bag to another for the sake of optics isn’t just bizarre — it’s a symptom. It’s a glitch in the code that now runs society.</p>
  
    <p>This isn’t accidental. It’s the result of a digital ecosystem that has silently reshaped human values. We’ve allowed an algorithm — one optimized for immediacy and outrage — to replace our moral compass. We’ve chipped away at the pillars of meaning, faith, and originality in exchange for reaction, friction, and virality. The average person doesn’t even realize that nearly everything they consume, believe, or repeat is curated by an invisible machine. The news, the trending topics, the narratives — all filtered through a system designed not to enlighten, but to stimulate.</p>
  
    <p>And the cruelest irony? The people most frustrated by this system often secretly need it. It gives them a sponge. A soft, manufactured enemy to absorb all their angst so they don’t have to look inward. Meghan Markle, Donald Trump — they become therapy for the distracted masses. Effigies for the disempowered. Symbols of everything wrong, so we never have to confront what’s actually wrong.</p>
  
    <p>The MegTrick isn’t just about Meghan. It’s about all of us. And the more we participate, the more it wins.</p>
