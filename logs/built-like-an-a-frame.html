            <p>The other day, my best friend sent me a photo of something he’d just built — an A-frame structure made of wood, designed to hold up an archery target. (Technically, it’s called a target stand, but that doesn’t quite capture the weight of what I felt.) At that exact moment, I happened to be working in <em>A-Frame</em>, a virtual reality framework I use to construct 3D environments. Two completely different contexts — his physical, mine digital — but somehow, the same word, the same shape, the same intent: to build something that holds.</p><p>That coincidence stayed with me. It reminded me how our friendship works — how, despite being in entirely different worlds, with different tools and terrains, we keep creating in parallel. He’s out there building things you can touch. I’m here building things you can’t. But both of us are guided by structure, function, and form. Both of us are trying to hold something up.</p><p>The A-frame became a quiet metaphor. It’s not something that sits between us — it’s something that supports us, that mirrors the shape of our friendship. An A-frame is simple but strong, designed to bear weight without buckling. That’s what we’ve built over time: a connection that doesn’t rely on shared location, shared work, or even constant contact — just a deep structural understanding. When pressure comes, we don’t collapse. We hold.</p><p>Most friendships are built on surface overlap: same city, same job, same community. But ours runs deeper. We’re not connected by circumstance; we’re connected by design. And that design has proven itself. It’s resilient, balanced, and quietly powerful — just like the wooden frame he made, just like the virtual one I coded.</p><p>Different mediums. Different methods. But the same instinct: to build something that lasts.</p>
