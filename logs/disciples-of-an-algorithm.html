            <h3 id="the-misalignment-of-creation">The Misalignment of Creation</h3><p>For fifteen years, I worked in the creative industry, navigating a world of design, branding, and innovation. On the surface, it was inspiring—a place where ideas and creativity thrived. But as I spoke with the people behind the projects, I began to notice a troubling disconnect. There was often little correlation between the work they created and who they truly were. Their creations weren’t reflections of their values, beliefs, or essence. Instead, they were shaped by external forces: market trends, technological advancements, and the relentless desire to stay relevant.</p><p>This wasn’t just about profit; it was also about projecting an image of being at the forefront of innovation. Many creators embraced the latest technologies not because they resonated with their purpose but because it made them appear cutting-edge. It became clear that much of what was being created was less about meaning and more about maintaining the veneer of technological leadership. The work seemed hollow, designed to perform rather than align.</p><h3 id="the-paradox-of-profit">The Paradox of Profit</h3><p>What struck me most was the paradox at the heart of this system. Many of these creators were producing unsustainable or even harmful products, yet they used the profits to improve the lives of those closest to them. For instance, companies that sold unhealthy products while their executives lived healthier lives, or creators who championed trends they didn’t believe in to maintain their place in a system they secretly rejected. It was a troubling cycle: using resources gained through disconnection to create personal alignment, while others bore the cost.</p><p>This misalignment isn’t just about business decisions; it’s a reflection of a larger cultural shift. Many people today have become what I call <em>disciples of an algorithm</em>. They allow algorithms and digital trends to dictate what they create, how they present themselves, and even what they value. Algorithms promise recognition, relevance, and prosperity, but they deliver little more than fleeting validation. In this world, true alignment—creating from your essence and living in accordance with your values—has become increasingly rare.</p><h3 id="the-risk-of-alignment">The Risk of Alignment</h3><p>This realization led me to recalibrate my own approach to life and work. I made the decision to align my physical, mental, spiritual, and creative self. But choosing alignment comes with risk. In a culture that celebrates metrics, trends, and appearances, stepping away from those systems to create from a place of truth is countercultural. It challenges the norm and often means rejecting immediate success in favor of long-term fulfillment.</p><p>I understand the irony in this choice. Alignment, which should bring clarity and peace, often creates tension and difficulty. Jesus Himself warned us of this when He said, <em>“In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).</em> Following Christ—choosing to anchor my life in truth—doesn’t guarantee an easier path. Instead, it demands faith, persistence, and a willingness to endure the challenges that come with living authentically.</p><h3 id="faith-in-truth">Faith in Truth</h3><p>Despite the risks, I am willing to take this step. I am willing to have faith in my truth, and that truth aligns with Jesus Christ. At the top of the hierarchy of alignment, Christ provides the foundation for everything I do. Faith in Him gives meaning to the risks I take and allows me to embrace the challenges of this path.</p><p>This is not about perfection; it’s about integrity. It’s about ensuring that the work I create reflects who I am and what I believe, even if the world doesn’t reward it. The alignment of my creative, spiritual, mental, and physical self is not just a goal—it’s a commitment. And it’s rooted in faith that the truth of Jesus Christ is greater than any trend, algorithm, or fleeting validation.</p><h3 id="the-question-of-sustainability">The Question of Sustainability</h3><p>In a world where so many are following the discipleship of an algorithm, I’ve chosen to follow Christ. This recalibration has challenged me to reject the pressures of technology, trends, and market demands, and instead create from a place of purpose. The path isn’t easy—it’s risky, difficult, and at times lonely. But it’s also fulfilling. It’s sustainable. It’s true.</p><p>So I leave you with this question: which is the more sustainable concept? Following the fluctuating demands of algorithms and trends, or anchoring your life in the eternal truth of Jesus Christ?</p>
