            <p>We live in a time of creative saturation. Every platform is overflowing — with ideas, images, designs, music, writing. And in this endless stream, quality is no longer the metric by which value is assigned. Today, value comes from affiliation — from who made it, who it’s connected to, and what signals it sends to the surrounding culture.</p><p>Creativity has become secondary to persona. The work itself is often invisible until it’s validated by something external: a brand, a name, a political position, a platform. You can craft something brilliant, thoughtful, original — and people won’t even know how to see it until they’ve asked the underlying question: “What’s it for?”</p><p>That’s the moment everything gets filtered. If you say, “It’s for Nike,” the tone shifts. The same object, once met with confusion, is now treated as genius. You’re not more talented than you were five seconds ago — but you’ve now passed through the gate of affiliation. This is the condition of creative work today: value is inferred from the context that surrounds the object, not from the object itself.</p><p>This behavior isn’t random — it’s cognitive.</p><p>Most people are empirical types. They process the world through what’s observable, measurable, and socially confirmed. They don’t assign value based on depth or ambiguity — they look for external validation. They check who else approves, who’s behind it, who it’s for. In this system, unknown creators are filtered out not because their work lacks meaning, but because meaning isn’t detectable without an anchor.</p><p>You see it in every domain, including politics. Tesla — once the symbol of progressive innovation — is now avoided by many left-leaning consumers simply because of Elon Musk’s affiliation with Donald Trump. As a result, some Americans are choosing Chinese-made EVs over a superior domestic product, undermining their own manufacturing base just to avoid the signal. Again, the logic is less about quality and more about perception: who is behind this?</p><p>This is also why the cultural space remains locked in nostalgia. Van Gogh’s work, though endlessly recycled and repackaged, continues to sell out immersive exhibitions. Not because the work is evolving — but because the name still carries weight. Meanwhile, contemporary artists with fresher ideas and better-suited mediums go unseen. The future is delayed — not because we lack talent, but because empirical types slow the rate of cultural acceptance. They require consensus before change. Which is why progress, in art and design, arrives in tiny, incremental steps.</p><p>So if we look at this through a cognitive lens, it becomes clear: it’s not about timing or luck — it’s about who your audience is. If you release something conceptual, something future-oriented, into a market dominated by empirical types, it will likely be ignored. But if your audience is primarily conceptual — open, forward-facing, abstract-minded — you’ll find acceptance much faster. It’s not personal. It’s not random. It’s cognitive math.</p><hr><p><strong>So where’s the way forward?</strong></p><p>It’s not necessarily in fighting the system — it’s in choosing the right domain. While creative work is judged through a filter of persona and politics, technology offers something different: neutrality through function. If you build something that works — something that solves a real problem — people will use it. The need bypasses the filter. The name doesn’t matter.</p><p>Take DeepSeek, for example — a Chinese language model that recently entered the Western AI space. Few had heard of it until it began outperforming expectations. It wasn’t hyped. It didn’t carry celebrity. It just worked. And people noticed — not because they were told to, but because it offered clear, measurable utility.</p><p>This is the paradox of creativity today: the more ambiguous or interpretive your work, the more it depends on context to be understood. But the more useful your work is, the more it can stand alone.</p><p>So if you're an unknown creator, this is the hard truth: in a world dominated by empirical types — people who need external validation before assigning value — your work won’t matter unless <em>you</em> matter. And if you choose not to play that game, then build something so useful, so frictionless, that it can’t be ignored. Not because of who made it, but because of what it does.</p>
