            <p>Shouldn’t the world reward great ideas, truth, and visionary thinking? Shouldn’t intelligence, strategy, and insight be the currency that determines influence?</p><p>Once upon a time, that may have been the case. But today, the world doesn’t care what’s inside your mind—it only cares about what you can express to the outside world.</p><p>You could have the best ideas in existence, but if you can’t capture attention, they’ll sink to the bottom, unnoticed and unheard—like treasures buried in the ocean. Meanwhile, others, with less substance but greater visibility, ride the waves of public attention, shaping conversations, movements, and economies.</p><p>Take Elon Musk, for example. Internally, from his own perspective—and that of any rational observer—his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is a logical effort to streamline federal operations by upgrading computing systems. Musk, often calling himself "tech support," sees cost-cutting measures like dismantling USAID as a necessary step to reduce government spending and address national debt.</p><p>But to the outside world, particularly emotionally driven, hyper-expressive Democrats, his actions are framed entirely differently. Rather than seeing a pragmatic financial decision, they brand him a fascist, insisting that billionaires shouldn’t interfere with government affairs.</p><p>For context, in 2024, the U.S. contributed approximately 42% of global foreign aid, making it a major force in international assistance. But to pay off its own debts, drastic spending cuts are unavoidable. Musk, applying straightforward logic, prioritizes financial sustainability.</p><p>Yet what dominates the conversation isn’t Musk’s reasoning or his calculated policies—it’s the performative outrage flooding social media. Loud, hyper-aggressive voices amplify emotional reactions, turning them into headlines.</p><p>And of course, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel play their part, with their forced and uninspired monologues—more about ideological reinforcement than comedy—indoctrinating their audiences with the latest anti-Republican narrative fed to them by the deep-state swamp. Every facet of their shows is intertwined with political messaging. They can’t even talk about eggs without referencing Trump or Musk.</p><p>The irony is glaring: the same progressive circles that claim to champion inclusivity and mental health awareness were the first to mock Musk’s Asperger’s. This hypocrisy was on full display during a <em>Saturday Night Live</em> skit, where Mike Myers exaggerated Musk’s mannerisms in a way many found distasteful—especially given Musk’s openness about his neurodivergence.</p><p>This attention economy dynamic was also evident in a heated exchange between Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelensky, and JD Vance. What was meant to be a diplomatic meeting devolved into a spectacle. Zelensky clashed with Trump, who was infuriated by his perceived lack of gratitude. Meanwhile, Vance voiced concerns over continued military aid to Ukraine. Instead of a measured debate, the moment exploded—reminiscent of the bank heist gone wrong in Michael Mann's <em>Heat</em>, spilling out onto the streets for all to see. Even Trump, ever aware of performative drama, quipped, <em>"This is going to be great television."</em></p><p>What captivated audiences wasn’t the policy debate or its implications—it was the raw emotional intensity. The modern media landscape doesn’t reward careful reasoning; it rewards theatrical displays of emotion.</p><h3 id="the-core-principle-of-the-attention-economy"><strong>The Core Principle of the Attention Economy</strong></h3><p>It’s not about truth. It’s about perception.</p><p>And in this system, the ability to express oneself, capture emotions, and engage audiences is far more valuable than silent competence.</p><p>With that in mind, here’s the <em>Commercial Viability Hierarchy</em>—ranked using the MBTI system. Check your type and see where you rank in the attention economy:</p><hr><h3 id="the-commercial-viability-hierarchy"><strong>The Commercial Viability Hierarchy</strong></h3><h4 id="riding-the-waves-highly-visible-engaging"><strong>Riding the Waves (Highly Visible &amp; Engaging)</strong></h4><p>These personalities thrive in social spaces, command attention, and are naturally suited for the attention economy.</p><ul><li><strong>ENFP</strong> – Influential bloggers, motivational speakers, lifestyle influencers.</li><li><strong>ESFP</strong> – Actors, musicians, live streamers.</li><li><strong>ENTP</strong> – Podcast hosts, commentators, satirists.</li><li><strong>ENTJ</strong> – CEOs, media moguls, political figures.</li></ul><h4 id="beneath-the-surface-moderately-visible-engaging"><strong>Beneath the Surface (Moderately Visible &amp; Engaging)</strong></h4><p>These types have strong social skills but don’t necessarily seek attention as their primary goal.</p><ul><li><strong>ESFJ</strong> – Event planners, community organizers, family vloggers.</li><li><strong>ESTP</strong> – Business influencers, reality TV personalities, adventure vloggers.</li><li><strong>ENFJ</strong> – Coaches, public figures, advocates.</li><li><strong>ESTJ</strong> – Corporate leaders, political figures, industry experts.</li></ul><h4 id="deeper-waters-less-visible-selectively-engaging"><strong>Deeper Waters (Less Visible &amp; Selectively Engaging)</strong></h4><p>These personalities can be captivating in their niche but are not naturally inclined toward mass visibility.</p><ul><li><strong>ISTP</strong> – DIY creators, tech reviewers, explorers.</li><li><strong>ISFP</strong> – Photographers, indie artists, craft enthusiasts.</li><li><strong>INFP</strong> – Poets, novelists, indie filmmakers.</li><li><strong>INFJ</strong> – Counselors, thought leaders, niche influencers.</li></ul><h4 id="the-abyss-minimally-visible-private"><strong>The Abyss (Minimally Visible &amp; Private)</strong></h4><p>These types actively avoid public attention and prefer control over their personal image.</p><ul><li><strong>ISFJ</strong> – Archivists, support staff, community caretakers.</li><li><strong>ISTJ</strong> – Analysts, behind-the-scenes experts, corporate leaders.</li><li><strong>INTP</strong> – Science communicators, anonymous bloggers, niche podcasters.</li><li><strong>INTJ</strong> – Researchers, strategists, anonymous visionaries.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="and-what-about-intjs"><strong>And What About INTJs?</strong></h3><p>Are INTJs doomed to remain invisible forever? Not exactly.</p><p>If INTJs are to succeed, it won’t be by forcing themselves into the realm of emotional expression—a game they were never designed to play. Instead, their power lies in mastering the abyss and directing those above.</p><p>Rather than becoming influencers or public figures, INTJs excel in designing the systems that shape the world. They are the strategists, the architects, the unseen masterminds who understand how things work and pull the right strings at the right time.</p><p>They don’t need attention. They create the frameworks that dictate what everyone else pays attention to.</p>
