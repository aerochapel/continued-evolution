            <p>There’s a particular kind of absurdity that defines modern travel — a performance of wonder that, in truth, conceals an orchestrated discomfort. It’s as if the entire system were designed by someone with the empathy of George Soros and the aesthetic sensibility of a stock exchange.</p><p>It begins, inevitably, in the airport: a gleaming, hyper-lit liminal space where you’re immediately reduced to a barcoded consumer. The highest aspiration in this environment is to queue, loiter, and be sold to — not just products, but an ideology. An assumption about who you are and what you should want. Apparently, what you want is a duty-free shopping spree, or a nostalgic visit to a mid-tier sandwich chain you’d forgotten existed — one that vanished from your country two decades ago, only to reappear in a Kuala Lumpur departure lounge, haunting you with its lifeless, pre-wrapped offerings like a culinary ghost clinging to relevance.</p><p>Travel is supposed to be about escape. Yet airports reintroduce you to the very mediocrity you tried to leave behind.</p><p>You become a subject in circulation — shepherded like a ready meal through the packaging stages of a global factory. You’re interrogated by staff who seem to take pleasure in reminding you of their bureaucratic power, all within a shopping mall duct-taped to a runway.</p><p>The air is thick with perfume — pumped aggressively from duty-free stores to remind you that you are no longer breathing oxygen, but commerce. The entire concourse has the feel of a globalization-themed obstacle course, its architecture of distraction meticulously designed to sedate.</p><p>You pass glassy storefronts selling bags no one needs and watches no one wants. These are desperation stores — targeting Asian markets in the hope they haven’t yet realized that buying useless luxury goods offers no fulfillment. Like a virus that wasn’t contained, Western consumerism has seeped outward, convincing people they need a European handbag from a continent that no longer resembles the luxury it claims to represent.</p><p>The whole place feels like a dystopian mall polished while everyone sleeps, held together by overpriced caffeine and scented air. All you want is a simple bar of chocolate, but the only option is a Toblerone the size of a railroad tie. Need water? Here’s a glass bottle of artisanal sparkling water — as if you’re here to celebrate, not survive. What you really need is to be intravenously dosed with a 9% Belgian beer to get through the ordeal.</p><p>Eventually, inevitably, you reach your gate — a sad arrangement of bolted chairs all facing one another, designed specifically to eradicate any last trace of solitude. You are no longer a traveler. You are now cargo for an aluminum cylinder preparing to defy gravity.</p><p><strong>Upon arrival at your destination, the cycle begins all over again.</strong> You're deposited into another line — this time for immigration — where, dazed and sleep-deprived, you’re asked to prove your face still matches your passport. And in a final stroke of Kafkaesque genius, you’re told you can avoid this next time by registering for the automated gates. But the catch? You can only register upon arrival. You must queue in order to earn the right to someday not queue. You can’t do it online. You can’t prepare in advance. You must physically stand in the very arrivals hall you were hoping to bypass, like a bureaucratic snake eating its own tail.</p><p>And finally, you arrive at the hotel — only to share breakfast with the very same people you were funneled through the airport with. Nothing says cultural immersion like eating a buffet omelet next to another sunburned tourist discussing exchange rates.</p><p>After years of living abroad and seeing the world, I can tell you this: travel does not bring fulfillment. The only fulfilling travel is migration — escaping dysfunction, not sampling it. You may collect experiences, sure. But you will not become more whole. You will become more tired.</p><p>If you want meaning, find God. Or build something. Or learn to code.</p><p>It’s like living next to a vast, breathtaking ocean and choosing instead to visit a chlorinated waterpark — because it condenses the spectacle into one convenient, Instagrammable frame.</p><p>So if you like flying, make sure the following boxes are ticked:</p><ul><li>You enjoy progressive crowds.</li><li>You enjoy queues.</li><li>You enjoy sitting elbow-to-elbow with strangers who, like you, find joy in the endless cycle of moving, eating, waiting, and repeating.</li></ul>
