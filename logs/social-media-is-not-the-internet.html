            <p>The Trump 2.0 presidency is already bringing shifts, one of the most significant being the revival of critical thinking and independent thought. Over the next few years, I believe this cultural awakening will cascade into other Western countries, reshaping the landscape of not only politics but also the way we interact with the digital world. As we examine the internet in its current state, one thing becomes increasingly clear: its foundation, anchored on social media platforms, is unsustainable.</p><p>Social media has dominated our digital lives for over a decade, but it has become a turbulent space. Designed as tools for connection and self-expression, platforms like Facebook and Instagram have morphed into mechanisms for surveillance, data farming, and relentless advertising. Their utility is undeniable, especially for promotion, but they’re increasingly precarious as long-term solutions for independent creators. We must rethink our relationship with these platforms and move toward something more sustainable and aligned with individual autonomy.</p><hr><h3 id="a-return-to-individual-platforms"><strong>A Return to Individual Platforms</strong></h3><p>The internet wasn’t always like this. There was a time when it was a playground of bespoke websites, each one a unique reflection of its creator. Even though these sites lacked the sophistication of modern design and SEO capabilities, they offered something far more valuable: individuality. Today, with our advanced understanding of digital expression, we have an opportunity to return to that ethos and build on it.</p><p>Rather than relying on pre-existing platforms like Squarespace or Wix, which still tether creators to templates and limitations, we need to embrace the art of building truly independent sites. By doing so, we regain control over how we present ourselves, our work, and our ideas. This isn’t just a nostalgic throwback; it’s a necessary evolution.</p><p>With the tools now at our disposal, we can take everything we’ve learned from the era of social media—whether it’s how to use AI to write code, how to present ideas visually, or how to structure content—and bring those lessons back to the art of independent site creation. These digital tools, if used correctly, should bring us closer to our true nature, whether that’s our individual essence or the natural world around us. Our real nature is not reflected in the shallow, cookie-cutter structures of social media. It’s found in the bespoke spaces we create, free from the limitations imposed by platforms designed for mass consumption and data exploitation.</p><hr><h3 id="the-social-media-trap"><strong>The Social Media Trap</strong></h3><p>Personally, I haven’t used social media since 2012. I opted out because I couldn’t reconcile my goals with the superficial noise that dominates those platforms. If I’m selling crafted oak tables, I don’t want that message surrounded by selfies, memes, and irrelevant ads. Social media’s structure forces us to compete for attention in a space that often feels detached from meaningful pursuits.</p><p>When we participate in social media, we’re not in control; we’re being controlled by noise. Imagine the National Gallery in London inundated every day with every single JPEG uploaded to some random social media website. How would it separate the wheat from the chaff—the Holbeins and the Rembrandts—from the noise? It would be impossible. And this is exactly what we’re doing to the internet. We’re diluting its potential by bombarding it with irrelevant, shallow content, infantilizing what could be a profound tool for human expression and innovation.</p><p>By supporting and creating for social media, we further this infantilization. Instead of building meaningful content for ourselves and our audiences, we’re playing into a system that exploits our need for validation and trains us to compete for attention. This constant battle for visibility not only distorts the value of ideas but also affects our psychology in profound ways, leading to widespread anxiety, depression, and a loss of focus.</p><hr><h3 id="transparency-and-autonomy"><strong>Transparency and Autonomy</strong></h3><p>The Trump era underscores the power of independent media. With mainstream media facing widespread distrust, independent outlets have emerged as more transparent and authentic alternatives. This same principle should now apply to the way we create and share on the internet. We can no longer afford to be entirely dependent on massive platforms that prioritize their own agendas over our autonomy.</p><p>Social media platforms are increasingly influenced by political events, corporate interests, and societal turbulence. This makes them volatile and unreliable for long-term planning. What happens if a platform becomes irrelevant or collapses under its own weight? The answer is clear: we need to build digital spaces we fully control.</p><hr><h3 id="building-the-internet%E2%80%99s-future"><strong>Building the Internet’s Future</strong></h3><p>As technology becomes more sophisticated, the number of independent creators will grow exponentially. Digital tools now allow for unprecedented autonomy, enabling creators to work from anywhere and reach audiences globally. This is a powerful shift, but it comes with responsibility.</p><p>We need to manage this growth thoughtfully, and that begins with curation. Some argue that curation is subjective, but this isn’t entirely true. Just as there are fundamental principles that make a cathedral awe-inspiring compared to a multi-story car park, there are objective qualities that define great work. Vision, craftsmanship, and originality are timeless benchmarks that transcend trends.</p><p>AI, when used responsibly, can play a significant role in this process. By helping to identify quality work and bringing it to the forefront, AI can support a merit-based internet where the best ideas, not the loudest voices, rise to prominence.</p><p>The next chapter of the internet should be about reclaiming control. It’s about creating a digital landscape where individual platforms flourish, free from the noise and influence of centralized giants. Just as we’ve moved away from relying on mainstream media, we can move away from over-reliance on social media.</p><p>This shift won’t happen overnight, but it’s a necessary evolution. By investing in our own digital spaces, we can ensure sustainability, autonomy, and a future where independent thought thrives. As creators, we have the tools, the vision, and the responsibility to make this happen.</p><p>The internet of the future isn’t about algorithms and grids—it’s about individuality, authenticity, and ownership. Let’s start building it today.</p>
