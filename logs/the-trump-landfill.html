            <p>In Christianity, sin is not the end of the story. When you fall short, you confess. You bring your guilt to Christ, and through forgiveness, you're released—not just from punishment, but from the burden of carrying it alone. There is a structure to restoration. You take responsibility. You repent. And you're made new.</p><p>But in a culture that has cut itself off from God, sin doesn’t disappear—it gets displaced. In place of Christ, we’ve chosen scapegoats. And no scapegoat has been more relentlessly used in recent years than Donald Trump.</p><p>For many, Trump is not just a political figure; he’s a kind of emotional landfill. Whatever doesn’t sit right in their own life—bitterness, career regret, relational dysfunction, personal failure—gets dumped on him. He becomes the reason they’re unhappy, the symbol of everything wrong in the world. Elon Musk is now joining that role too. It’s no longer introspection that brings relief, but projection. Instead of asking, <em>what am I doing wrong?</em> the question becomes <em>who can I blame for how I feel?</em></p><p>Even in matters like tariffs, the outrage is often misplaced. People forget that tariffs expose our own dependency on cheap, foreign goods—goods produced under conditions we’d never tolerate at home. It’s not Trump’s fault that ethical consumerism comes at a cost. It’s our fault for pretending it didn’t.</p><p>This fixation on external villains reveals something deeper: we’ve lost the ability to process guilt. Without a divine framework for forgiveness, we outsource our sins to public figures. And the more lost we become, the louder the accusations get—because it’s easier to scream at a stranger than to examine your own reflection.</p><p>In the end, it’s not about Trump. It’s about us.</p>
