    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Cavity of Your Cognition</h2>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">29 Mar 2025</p>
  
    <p>In architecture, a cavity wall is made of two solid surfaces — an inner wall and an outer wall — with a narrow airspace between them. That space isn’t wasted. It’s what allows the structure to breathe, balance, and function in different environments.</p>
    <p>At Bodin, we see the mind in a similar way.</p>
    <p>Most systems ask whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert — but we think that question misses the point. You’re not just one or the other. You're constantly shifting based on your environment. The way your mind operates depends on what kind of room you’re in — and who’s in it with you.</p>
    <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ul class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 ml-5 list-disc">
      <li>Your inner wall is where your private cognition lives. It’s the quiet place — the part of you that plans, reflects, solves problems, and makes sense of things in silence.</li>
      <li>Your outer wall is your visible behavior — how you speak, react, and express ideas in the moment, especially in social situations.</li>
      <li>And in between is your cavity — the relay zone. This is the space where your inner thoughts are turned into outward expression — and where outside experiences are filtered inward and made meaningful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn’t static. It moves.</p>
    <p>If you're in an environment that suits you — one that feels natural, stimulating, or aligned — your outer wall lights up. You feel seen. You participate more. Even if you're normally quiet, something inside flows out effortlessly.</p>
    <p>But if you’re in the <em>wrong</em> environment — one that feels forced, shallow, or misaligned — your outer wall goes dim. You fall back into your internal space. This happens to everyone, regardless of how they’re labeled.</p>
    <p>For example, someone who’s considered an “extrovert” might completely withdraw if they’re surrounded by people who only speak in abstractions, or value depth over pace. They’ll retreat inward, feel out of place, even feel a sense of despair. Meanwhile, a so-called “introvert” might light up in that exact environment — because it finally mirrors how they think.</p>
    <p>The point is: your mind is always adjusting. And that adjustment happens inside the cavity — the in-between space where cognition shifts, translates, and adapts.</p>
    <p>Some people live mostly on the inside. Others stay fully external. But many — especially those with measured, pragmatic, or dynamic minds — live in that cavity. They translate constantly. They adapt. They shift their signal based on what kind of frequency the room can receive.</p>
    <p>That relay space — quiet but vital — is the cavity of your cognition.</p>
    <p>It’s not a fixed trait. It’s a functional space.<br>You may never see it. But it’s always working — filtering, converting, translating.<br>It’s not who you are.<br>It’s how you move.</p>
