    <p><strong><em>"The internet didn’t lose its soul by accident. It lost it when access replaced intention."</em></strong></p>
  
    <p>There was a time when the internet felt like a secret. A frontier. It was built by people with vision — people who weren’t satisfied with the world as it was. Conceptual minds. Explorers. Creators. The internet was their canvas, and they used it to build strange forums, hand-coded websites, bizarre games, and obscure ideas. You had to look for things. You had to want something <em>different</em>.</p>
  
    <p>But then social media arrived — and everything changed.</p>
  
    <p>Social media didn’t just make the internet easier. It made it cognitively accessible. It welcomed in empirical types — people who think through what’s immediate, sensory, and concrete. The ones who scroll, swipe, tap, react. And once they became the majority, the internet began to shift around <em>them</em>.</p>
  
    <p>The algorithm didn’t get worse. It just became a mirror. A mirror for a mind that needs stimulation <em>now</em>, not meaning later. A mirror for consumption, not exploration.</p>
  
    <p>And in that shift, something fundamental broke:<br>
    The internet stopped being an alternative to reality — and became an <strong>exaggeration</strong> of it.</p>
  
    <p>Empirical types fixate on the <em>human form</em> — on faces, bodies, personalities, expressions. And so, the platforms they influence follow suit. Instead of strange ideas or abstract thought, everything now revolves around <em>people</em>. Influencers. Reactions. Selfies. Feeds filled with real humans performing enhanced versions of everyday life.</p>
  
    <p>What made the old internet fascinating was its <strong>roughness</strong>. Its mystery. It wasn’t polished, and that’s what gave it <em>soul</em>. It wasn’t mimicking life — it was <em>escaping</em> it. But now, like modern video games that sacrifice gameplay for hyperreal graphics, or televisions that sell you on pixels instead of storytelling, the internet has traded imagination for detail. We’ve cleaned it up. Rounded the corners. Standardized the templates. Polished it until it’s sterile.</p>
  
    <p>You don’t feel the edge anymore. You don’t stumble on the strange. You just see more of what you already know — but in high resolution.</p>
  
    <p>And you can see it in the design of everything.</p>
  
    <p>Even if you build a site from scratch — write your own code, design a custom interface, embed meaning into every detail — it still ends up <em>feeling</em> like a Squarespace template. Because that’s what people expect now. That’s what their brains have been trained to accept. Mobile-first thinking has turned websites into vertical conveyor belts: stacked images, block text, and swipe-down simplicity. There’s no room for nuance. No room for subtlety. You <em>could</em> create something beautiful — an interface that makes standard design feel prehistoric — but most users would bounce. They’re not looking for interaction. They’re looking for frictionless consumption.</p>
  
    <p>And this is the paradox: the more accessible the internet becomes, the less <em>curious</em> it feels.</p>
  
    <p>Content is designed for phones. Behavior is modeled after youth. A 12-year-old with zero attention span can influence what shows up in the feed of a 45-year-old adult who’s trying to find depth. It's not that humans <em>can’t</em> focus anymore. It's that they’re never given a reason to. The problem isn’t attention — it’s <strong>attention anxiety</strong>. When you’re surrounded by an endless sea of content, your instinct isn’t to slow down — it’s to scan as much as you can. To keep moving. To not miss out. That’s what drives the “short attention span” myth. People still want substance. They just don’t know where to find it — because nothing is <em>curated</em>.</p>
  
    <p>So content gets flattened. Ideas get diluted. Platforms become echo chambers for the lowest cognitive denominator. And the worst part? Even conceptual creators — the ones who <em>could</em> elevate the system — now feel pressured to adapt. They yell in their videos. They simplify their writing. They follow formulas they don’t believe in. It’s like watching the quiet kid from the library pretend he’s into keg stands. It’s obvious. It’s painful. And it’s everywhere.</p>
  
    <p>And maybe the most alienating feeling in all of this is being in a digital space surrounded by people who don’t even know <em>why</em> they’re there. They’re just floating — reposting, reacting, recycling. They’re not guided by any principle. No vision. Just trends. It’s like being in a foreign country overrun by tourists who don’t understand the culture — who came because flights were cheap or someone on TikTok made it look “cool.” And they’re the ones filming everything. Hashtagging everything. Making viral content that pulls in even <em>more</em> people like them. Meanwhile, the people who <em>could</em> express the soul of that place — who actually <em>understand</em> it — are drowned out. Ignored.</p>
  
    <p>The internet wasn’t built for that. It wasn’t meant to exaggerate what already exists in reality. It was meant to <strong>expand</strong> it — to give voice to new thought, new structure, new beauty. Not to simulate chaos, or reduce everything to controversy. Not to reward mimicry over invention.</p>
  
    <p>But here we are — and every day online feels like the same show on repeat. The algorithm favors what’s predictable. Platforms are shaped by kids who haven’t yet developed taste. Tools are diluted by people who need step-by-step instructions. And the few people who could <em>actually</em> use these tools to build something original? They’re buried under the noise.</p>
  
    <p>We don’t need more content.<br>
    We need <strong>principle</strong>.<br>
    We need more <strong>cognitive authorship</strong>.<br>
    More original minds shaping new spaces. More builders. More thinkers. More creators of reality — not just consumers of it.</p>
  
    <p><strong>The internet didn’t lose its soul by accident.</strong><br>
    It lost it when access replaced intention.<br>
    It lost it when we stopped asking: <em>What is this even for?</em></p>
