            <p>Imagine walking into a camera shop. It’s a space filled with every conceivable lens, camera body, and accessory—rows of pristine glass and metal tools designed to capture the world in infinite ways.</p><p>Now imagine you’ve been using the same lens your entire life, perhaps a macro lens that zooms in on the details of your immediate environment. This lens shows you the world as you’ve always known it—focused on the small, the immediate, and the tangible. It’s familiar, and it serves its purpose.</p><p>But then something extraordinary happens. You receive Christ, and suddenly it’s as though you’ve been handed a new lens—not just any lens, but the widest lens imaginable. Let’s call it an ultra-wide-angle lens, one that transforms your perspective. You step out of the shop, camera in hand, and begin to look at the world again.</p><p>Everything is different.</p><h3 id="a-transformed-perspective">A Transformed Perspective</h3><p>Through this wide-angle lens, you don’t just see the world—you see the bigger picture. The hierarchies, the systems, the products, and the hype that once seemed so important now appear insignificant, even laughable. The things you once valued—the career ladders, the consumer culture, the social media clout—lose their weight, as though their power to captivate you has been stripped away.</p><p>What’s more, you start to notice the cracks. The elaborate facades that society has built to prop up its idols begin to look flimsy and absurd. An IP like a Marvel franchise, a status symbol like the latest phone, or a trend like NFTs—they all shrink in significance when viewed through the lens of Christ.</p><h3 id="seeing-beyond-the-surface">Seeing Beyond the Surface</h3><p>This transformation is profound because it doesn’t just change what you see; it changes how you see. Before receiving Christ, you saw the world as it was presented to you. You accepted the surface-level narratives, the hype, and the systems as reality. But now, with the wide-angle lens, you see through them.</p><p>You begin to discern what matters and what doesn’t. You separate the wheat from the chaff, as the Bible puts it. You understand that much of what society elevates is empty—a chasing after the wind, as Ecclesiastes 1:14 says:<br><strong>"I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind."</strong></p><p>With Christ’s lens, you’re no longer confined to the narrow view of the earthly simulation. You’ve been given the ability to see eternity, to see the essence of things, and to understand the truth behind the illusions.</p><h3 id="caught-between-two-worlds">Caught Between Two Worlds</h3><p>Living with this new perspective isn’t always easy. As someone who creates and designs, I often find myself caught between two worlds. On the one hand, I’m still operating in the earthly simulation, conforming to its criteria and systems. On the other hand, I’ve been catapulted into a higher understanding, one that values truth over trend and essence over appearance.</p><p>This tension can be frustrating. You might think that creating something authentic, something deeply rooted in the essence of who you are, would hold more value than a superficial product. But in a world that prioritizes hype and consumerism, the opposite is often true.</p><p>This is the challenge of living as a Christian in a fallen world. You’ve been given the wide-angle lens, but you’re still surrounded by people using their narrow lenses. You see the bigger picture, but they’re focused on the immediate.</p><h3 id="god-as-the-ultimate-creator">God as the Ultimate Creator</h3><p>Yet, this struggle also brings a unique understanding of God’s role as the ultimate Creator. When you’ve been given a wide-angle view of the world, you begin to appreciate the intricacy and intentionality of God’s design. You see the harmony in creation, the beauty in its imperfections, and the profound depth of its purpose.</p><p>As a creative person, this understanding is both humbling and inspiring. It reminds me that my role is not to conform to the fleeting standards of the world but to reflect God’s eternal truth in my work.</p><h3 id="the-responsibility-of-a-wide-angle-lens">The Responsibility of a Wide-Angle Lens</h3><p>With this new perspective comes responsibility. When you see the world through the lens of Christ, you’re called to live differently. You’re called to reject the superficial and embrace the eternal, even when it’s difficult.</p><p>As 2 Corinthians 4:18 says:<br><strong>"So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."</strong></p><p>This means choosing truth over convenience, essence over appearance, and God’s kingdom over the earthly simulation. It’s not always easy, but it’s always worth it.</p><h3 id="conclusion-embracing-the-wide-angle-lens">Conclusion: Embracing the Wide-Angle Lens</h3><p>Receiving Christ is like being handed the ultimate wide-angle lens. It transforms your vision, revealing the truth behind the illusions and the eternal significance of what really matters.</p><p>With this lens, you see the world for what it truly is—a fleeting shadow of God’s greater plan. You understand that the things society elevates are often hollow, and you find freedom in letting go of their grip.</p><p>This wide-angle view comes with challenges, but it also brings clarity, purpose, and peace. It allows you to live not for the applause of the world but for the glory of God.</p><p>Step out of the shop, embrace the lens, and see the world through the eyes of Christ. You’ll never see it the same way again.</p>
