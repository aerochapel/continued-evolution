            <p>In a recent church service, a pastor spoke about the importance of giving—of using our unique gifts to serve both the church and the broader community. He highlighted the many ways Christians can contribute: leadership, prophecy, caregiving, teaching, and more. As I reflected on this message, I considered the real-world implications of discovering one’s purpose.</p><p>So, I asked the pastor: <em>How do you know you have the right talent?</em> It’s one thing to recognize that we all have gifts, but how do we discern if we are truly using the right ones? This question extends beyond faith; it is a fundamental issue in modern life. And as we increasingly merge with technology, we should not only be using it to diagnose health conditions or improve efficiency but also to refine and determine our purpose.</p><p>Many people struggle to understand what they are meant to do. From an early age, we are pushed into educational and career paths without knowing if they align with our strengths. Some instinctively find their way, but many spend years in jobs or studies that leave them unfulfilled. The modern world has only made this harder. With an overwhelming number of choices, information, and career possibilities, the result is often indecision and anxiety rather than clarity.</p><p>We need more than just access to opportunities—we need ways to make sense of them. Purpose isn’t something that should take decades to discover through trial and error. There must be a better way to distill what truly fits who we are.</p><p>One example of a system that helps narrow down how we think and process the world is the <strong>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</strong>. More than just a personality test, MBTI is a framework that reveals cognitive functions—how we take in information, make decisions, and interact with the world. These cognitive patterns shape the choices that feel most natural, the environments in which we thrive, and the work that aligns with our strengths.</p><p>Understanding cognitive functions is a critical first step, but purpose isn’t just about self-awareness—it’s about knowing how to apply that awareness in a meaningful way. This is where <strong>spiritual wisdom</strong> comes in, specifically <strong>Christian wisdom</strong>, which offers deep, timeless truths about purpose, service, and fulfillment. When psychological insight and spiritual guidance are combined, they provide a <strong>tool for perception</strong>, allowing us to see through the noise of modern life.</p><p>In today’s world, where distractions are endless and expectations are imposed from every direction, discovering purpose requires the ability to <strong>critically analyze the system around us</strong>. We need to be able to dissect, question, and see the <strong>essence</strong> in things rather than being overwhelmed by surface-level noise. However, before one can <strong>criticize</strong> a system effectively, they first need <strong>curiosity</strong>—a hunger to understand how things work.</p><p>A system that understands cognitive functions could actually heighten and elevate curiosity, making people more engaged in the world around them. Once curiosity is sparked, <strong>critical thinking</strong> follows. With sharp critical thinking skills, individuals can challenge the narratives imposed upon them—whether from culture, institutions, or social expectations—and see clearly what they are truly meant to do.</p><p>Right now, AI is being used to optimize workflows, analyze data, and distill vast amounts of information in seconds. Instead of spending hours sifting through job listings, reading countless self-help books, or watching endless motivational content, AI could accelerate the process by challenging individuals directly—asking deep, probing questions, creating simulations, and adapting based on real-time engagement.</p><p>Imagine an AI-driven system that integrates:</p><ul><li><strong>MBTI Cognitive Functions</strong> – To assess how individuals process information, make decisions, and interact with the world.</li><li><strong>Christian Wisdom</strong> – Drawing from biblical texts and religious teachings that provide timeless guidance on calling, service, and fulfillment.</li><li><strong>Intellectual Analysis</strong> – Using data, career trends, and skill assessments to match individuals with paths that are both meaningful and sustainable.</li></ul><p>By combining these perspectives, a system could be created that approaches purpose discovery from multiple angles. Instead of relying on a single method, it would offer a <strong>holistic</strong> approach that considers psychological tendencies, spiritual guidance, and practical application.</p><p>As globalization reshapes society and traditional career paths become less defined, identity and purpose are becoming more fluid. The old markers of success—job titles, degrees, or rigid career ladders—no longer apply in the same way. What remains is the power of <strong>ideas</strong> and the ability to apply those ideas in ways that create impact.</p><p>Without structured tools to help people navigate this complexity, we risk a future where more options do not lead to more fulfillment but to more confusion. The abundance of choice can be just as paralyzing as having too few options. Technology should not just be used for efficiency but for <strong>clarity</strong>—helping people determine, with precision, what they are truly meant to do.</p><p>The consequences of failing to address this problem are already visible. When people are in misaligned roles, frustration, disengagement, and burnout follow. Career dissatisfaction is often linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression. But when individuals find alignment between their strengths and their work, everything changes—fulfillment increases, creativity flourishes, and real impact is made.</p><p>In the Christian faith, it is believed that each person plays a role in God’s greater plan. Scripture teaches that <em>“we are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other”</em> (Romans 12:5). Just as a body functions best when each part operates as intended, society thrives when people are in roles that truly fit who they are.</p><p>Technology should not replace wisdom but refine and clarify it. Just as medicine heals the body, AI can serve as a tool for deep self-discovery—helping people uncover, with greater accuracy and efficiency, what they are meant to do. When psychological insight, spiritual wisdom, and AI-driven analysis work together, purpose discovery can move from something vague and abstract to something structured and actionable.</p><p>Instead of a world where people aimlessly search for meaning, we could create a future where each person finds their place—where their strengths are recognized, their purpose is clear, and they can make the greatest impact.</p><p>In a time of overwhelming choice, the ability to extract clarity is the most valuable tool we have. If we are to build a future where more people thrive, we must develop systems that don’t just tell us who we are—but actively help us become who we are meant to be.</p>
