            <p>There’s something quietly maddening about living in a capitalist system designed for invention, resilience, and progress — only to see its most prominent voices of criticism elevated not through contribution, but through performance. We’re told to build. We’re encouraged to create, evolve, and innovate — to rise above hardship through effort, ingenuity, and persistence. But many of the loudest cultural figures today have gained their authority by doing the opposite: not through building, but by condemning the very system that enables their comfort. They’ve accumulated enough wealth and platform to speak endlessly, unthinkingly, about why others should feel guilty for existing within a framework that requires survival.</p><p>Progressives, in particular, have mastered the art of moral guilt as currency. They tell us capitalism is corrupt while writing best-selling books and delivering $40,000 Zoom speeches on community and compassion — all bankrolled by the very mechanisms they despise. They insist that privilege must come with accountability — not personal accountability, but universal accountability. As though the simple fact of being born in a developed nation saddles every citizen with the responsibility for every injustice on Earth. Clean water in Africa? Your fault. War in Gaza? Your responsibility. Homelessness in California? Blame tax cuts.</p><p>But here’s the truth: we are not built to carry the weight of the world. We’re built to carry the weight of our lives, our families, and the realities immediately around us. The modern world — especially the progressive media world — has collapsed global suffering into a 6-inch screen and sold it to us as a subscription. Now, virtue is a product. Empathy is monetized. Guilt is a brand.</p><p>We have been psychologically rewired to believe that global awareness must lead to personal shame. But awareness isn’t the same as obligation. Technology has given us panoramic access to every war, every crisis, every inequality — and while it’s important to care, we must also recognize the limits of our agency. If we didn’t have our phones, we wouldn’t know. If we didn’t have 24/7 streams of curated outrage, we’d focus on the world we’re actually in. And that world — the real, tangible, personal one — still requires our attention, our energy, and our effort.</p><p>Capitalism may be flawed, but it is functional. It demands effort and rewards initiative. It doesn’t pretend to be fair, but it allows for the possibility of advancement — something no other system has managed at scale. The progressives who rage against it do so while benefiting from it in full. They sell narratives, not products. They signal virtue instead of creating value. And they do it all while condemning those who are actually building — people working long hours, taking risks, innovating, hiring others, and trying to improve systems rather than just complain about them.</p><p>This is the ultimate contradiction: that those who cry loudest about injustice often contribute least to its solution. Because real change is hard. It’s slow. It requires structure, sacrifice, and clarity. It’s much easier to retweet about oppression than to solve it. Much easier to shame the working class than to understand their constraints. Much easier to build a platform on sentiment than on substance.</p><p>And what fuels this endless loop? Sentimentality. Progressive ideology has become a self-reinforcing echo chamber of feelings — untethered from responsibility, from logic, or from results. It thrives on moral superiority, not moral clarity. And when combined with the global feed of suffering available at all times, it produces not wisdom but hysteria — an overactive conscience addicted to outrage.</p><p>So no — I won’t apologize for trying to survive in the system I was born into. I won’t apologize for wanting a roof over my head, or for working out, or for eating healthy, or for earning money to live a dignified life. Those are baseline values in any sane society. And I certainly won’t be lectured on capitalism by millionaires who make their living by preaching against it.</p><p>Progressives rage against capitalism because it reminds them of what they aren’t doing: building. Creating. Solving. They rage because outrage is easier than output.</p><p>But I live in the real world — not in their performance.</p>
