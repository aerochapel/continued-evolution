            <p>There are two kinds of people in the world: those who see with their eyes and those who see with their minds. The former live in the now, reacting only to the visible, the tangible, the immediate. The latter live one step ahead — uncomfortable, disruptive, often misunderstood — because they are shaping futures that haven’t materialized yet. Donald Trump’s tariffs, much like Elon Musk’s technological crusades, are not just economic maneuvers; they are symptoms of a deeper truth: we live in a cognitively starved society, dominated by the short-sighted, the sentimental, and the risk-averse.</p><p>Trump’s vision to revive American manufacturing through tariffs is not about protectionism in the traditional sense — it's about realignment. It’s a visionary attempt to reconstruct the foundations of the U.S. economy. Yes, it disrupts markets. Yes, it upends trade deals. But that’s precisely the point. Systems do not evolve through polite consensus; they evolve through friction, through chaos. Catastrophe, when rightly directed, becomes a tool for reconfiguration — like a Rubik’s Cube being violently twisted out of place, not to preserve the current color pattern, but to discover a new one entirely.</p><p>But not all disruption is the same. The kind of disruption initiated by builders and innovators has an underlying logic to it — a return to common sense. If you really sit down and think about it, these shifts are rooted in the natural laws of survival, innovation, and national sovereignty. They may be unpopular or uncomfortable, but they make sense at a fundamental, universal level. Compare that to the kind of disruption we often see from progressive leadership — forced, artificial, and unnecessary. It’s disruption for disruption’s sake. It’s a top-down engineering of society that tries to override natural dynamics in the name of equity or inclusion, without asking whether such frameworks actually enhance human life or resilience. You can’t manufacture balance. You can’t impose diversity. In nature, in meritocratic systems — in life itself — order emerges from competition, from adaptability, from the fittest rising to meet the moment.</p><p>No one designs ecosystems. They evolve. And the same should be true of human systems. That’s what the true visionaries understand. They don’t see superficial categories. They don’t get distracted by race, class, or identity. They see the essence of humanity — and that essence is capability. Everyone is capable if they put their mind to it. The key word is <em>mind,</em> not <em>eyes.</em></p><p>We have sleepwalked into a future none of us agreed to. Our holidays celebrate change with no change. Each New Year is a copy of the last. We cheer as the clock strikes midnight, yet the systems we depend on remain stagnant — same economy, same dependencies, same spiritual exhaustion. Tariffs, lockdowns, even stock market crashes — these are not just crises. They are wake-up calls. They force the eye-seers to pause, to reflect, to finally think.</p><p>Those who see with their minds understand this. They are not conventional thinkers. They are disruptors in a world allergic to disruption. When tariffs are imposed on China, it’s not to cause pain but to realign pain — to make us feel the cost of outsourcing not just economically, but existentially. What does it mean to be a citizen if your purchasing power feeds another nation’s economy while your neighbor goes jobless? What is national identity if it dissolves every time you choose convenience over sovereignty?</p><p>These aren't rhetorical questions. They’re the questions of those who still see with their minds. And for all the outrage they provoke, it’s the visionaries — the inventors, the builders, the recalibrators — who understand that a tariff is not a tax. It’s a challenge. A test of whether we are willing to choose long-term vision over short-term ease.</p><p>And yet, most people consume dystopia as entertainment. They sit through films like <em>The Matrix</em> or <em>Blade Runner</em>, marveling at the visuals, immersed in the drama — and then walk out of the cinema unchanged. They watch their own possible future projected onto a screen and dismiss it as fiction. They go back to their jobs, their consumption cycles, their distracted routines — forgetting that the future they just watched could very well be the one they are unconsciously building. But there are others who leave those same films disturbed, awakened. They don’t want to live in a future like that — so they set out to prevent it. To change it. That’s the mindset of those who see with their minds: the instinct not to accept the trajectory, but to reroute it.</p><p>The deepest irony is this: the very people who refuse to imagine the long-term benefits of something like tariffs — who claim they’re shortsighted or harmful — are the same ones who eagerly purchase products manufactured in factories they’ll never see, under conditions they’d never accept. They outsource their ethics as easily as they outsource their goods. They consume globally, pollute globally, spend globally — all while believing they are making rational, compassionate choices. But these types of people are the last ones we should rely on for policy, vision, or leadership. Why? Because they consume reality without ever questioning it. A farmer knows where their food comes from because they also produce. A businessperson understands how a product reaches a customer because they’ve built the infrastructure themselves. But those disconnected from creation — those whose careers revolve around abstract roles and surface-level functions — lack the dimensional understanding required to make meaningful decisions. They shouldn't be setting the course for nations. It is the creators, the builders, the originators of ideas — those who have touched the architecture of systems — who are best equipped to lead. Not the consumers, but the designers of reality. Those who can see the system <em>and</em> reshape it.</p><p>And here’s what makes it even more tragic: America is full of cognitively starved individuals — not just in elite circles, but in neighborhoods across the country. People who want to work. People with hands-on skill. People who understand machinery, engineering, manual labor, design — even people who could help integrate AI into domestic manufacturing — but they’re sitting idle, left out of the national conversation. They’re told their skills are obsolete, their time has passed, their way of life no longer fits into the moral narrative of “equity.” Instead, we applaud ourselves for virtue-signaling inclusivity while buying smartphones built in sweatshops. We ignore the people we <em>could</em> be empowering right here, and glorify the illusion of global compassion at the cost of national decay. Progressive ideology tells us to decay gracefully — to accept decline as long as it looks fair on paper. But fairness without vitality is still death. What this country needs is not passive equality, but active excellence.</p><p>Meanwhile, those with vision want to bring things closer. Closer to home. Closer to reality. Closer to the human hand and the human mind. Because true vision isn’t about seeing far — it’s about seeing clearly. It’s about building a world where the systems we depend on are visible, local, and accountable. That is the only kind of future worth having. And it won’t be created by those who see with their eyes. It will be built — painstakingly, chaotically, and necessarily — by those who see with their minds.</p>
