        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">28 Mar 2025</p>
        
            <p>I spent nearly a week in Ho Chi Minh City, accompanying someone on a business trip. And while I was there—mostly waiting, mostly observing as my analytical mind drilled down through the noise—I found myself watching the tourists.</p><p>What struck me wasn’t their behavior so much as their sameness. They wandered aimlessly through the streets like lemmings on loop—interchangeable, automated. Not just a handful of them, but legions. Westerners, mostly—filling the sidewalks in shorts and sleeveless shirts, identical aviator sunglasses, tribal tattoos. It was as if Agoda and TripAdvisor co-funded a factory somewhere, mass-producing these people for the ritual of purposeless travel.</p><p>They’d all stop at the same time to take the same photo, like concertgoers watching a live show through their phones. I caught myself thinking, <em>Why that? Why take a photo of that?</em> But it wasn’t about the subject. It was about the script. Somewhere, an influencer—or Bookings.com—had told them <em>this</em> was the moment. And so they obeyed. Whether it meant anything or not was irrelevant.</p><p>The streets weren’t the only part of the performance. The entire system seems built for it. Tan Son Nhat’s Terminal 2 is bursting at the seams—undersized and overburdened by the sudden influx of Westerners flooding into Southeast Asia post-lockdown, fresh from their pandemic-era “self-reflection.”</p><p>What fascinated me more, though, was how geographically contained the whole ritual was. Nearly all of it happens in one zone: District 1. Most tourists never leave it. Cross an invisible boundary, and they vanish. One moment, you’re in the thick of vest-wearing, tattooed wanderers. The next—gone. Replaced by the city's real pulse: locals, motion, survival.</p><p>Outside that perimeter, the city resumes its natural frequency. You see the street life that isn’t staged, the movement that isn’t curated. Inside District 1, it’s easy to forget you’re in Vietnam at all. But for many tourists, that <em>is</em> the appeal.</p><p>Cognitively speaking, Ho Chi Minh City is built for a certain kind of personality: Empirical, Sentient, and Unscripted. It’s not a place for planning or contemplation. It’s a stimulus-reactive system—motorbikes, vendors, honking horns, sudden detours. It rewards instinct, improvisation, emotional availability. For people who thrive on sensation, it’s a kind of paradise.</p><p>But if you’re wired for intentionality—if you arrive with a goal—it can feel almost hostile. You start asking, <em>Why are they here?</em> And the more you ask, the more absurd it all seems. As someone with a structured cognitive frame, I don’t find comfort in unstructured wandering. I don’t derive meaning from sipping imported lattes while watching locals scramble to survive as if they’re some ambient cultural backdrop—like a Tim Hecker track playing in the distance. I want things to make sense. I want <em>systems</em>. And when everything feels like a loop of unrehearsed gestures, it’s not liberating. It’s claustrophobic.</p><p>That same ambient disconnection showed up in the business meetings. We sat with people who clearly didn’t care about what they were doing. They couldn’t recall what was said in previous meetings. They answered questions vaguely, like they were extras in a scene they weren’t even watching. No continuity. No direction. No ownership.</p><p>Meanwhile, my mind kept redesigning the city around me—folding streets inward like an <em>Inception</em> scene. I couldn’t stop rearchitecting it. Someone had to.</p><p>There was one moment that crystallized everything.</p><p>We were in a meeting with an eccentric, business-minded guy. My partner—bright, kinetic, full of high-energy charisma—had just stepped out. I tried shifting the energy. I told him I liked the interior design of his office: the exposed wood grain, the earthy palette. It felt intentional, I said. A standout from the usual sterile spaces we’d seen.</p><p>His eyes flicked to his phone. “My friend is a good interior designer. She did it.”</p><p>And that was it.</p><p>No story. No thought. No engagement. Not because he didn’t care—but because he’d never been <em>asked</em> to. He had no vocabulary for reflection. When you live in a city that moves this fast, that makes this much noise, you’re not rewarded for thinking. You’re rewarded for reacting. Pause too long and you’ll get hit by a scooter. The city trains you out of introspection.</p><p>And yet—despite all of this—Ho Chi Minh City has something that cities like Kuala Lumpur don’t: soul.</p><p>KL is clean, modern, functional. But it’s sanitized to the point of hollowness. Overdesigned. Hyper-commercial. Fragmented by overengineered multiculturalism. It’s like a film made by committee—technically sound, emotionally vacant. The Petronas Towers are stunning, yes—but they’re monuments to capital, not culture. They don’t express Malaysia. They advertise it.</p><p>Ho Chi Minh, by contrast, is messy. But the mess is real. It has depth. Grit. Texture. It reminds me of Tokyo—if you stripped away the discipline and let the chaos roam free. There’s something deeply human in that. But a city that thrives on spontaneity eventually needs something else to grow: vision.</p><p>And that’s the opportunity.</p><p>The character is already here—etched into the architecture, the rhythm, the noise. The raw material is good. What’s missing is structure. Intention. Direction. If Ho Chi Minh embraced its spirit with clarity—with coherence and purpose—it could become something extraordinary. Not just a pit stop for wanderers. A destination for seekers. Not a loop, but a story. One with a spine.</p><p>And if you want proof that this isn’t just a feeling—it’s a pattern—look at the data.</p><p>Ho Chi Minh has one of the lowest revisit rates for Western tourists in Southeast Asia. People come once. They pass through District 1. They take the photo. They drink the coffee. They complete the script. Then they leave—and don’t return.</p><p>That’s the mark of shallow connection. It attracts attention, not <em>affection</em>. Movement, not meaning. When people love a place—when they connect with it—they go back. They <em>want</em> to go deeper. That’s why people return to Japan. There’s a cognitive richness there. Cultural architecture layered deep enough to explore again and again.</p><p>Vietnam doesn’t have that yet. It’s been optimized for short-term consumption—like a pop song you hear once and forget. It gets attention. But not commitment.</p><p>But it could be different.</p><p>If Ho Chi Minh leaned into what it already has—its grit, its intensity, its heartbeat—and wove it into a real vision, it could attract a different kind of traveler. Not just the ones looking for cheap beer and Instagrammable cafes—but the ones searching for something <em>true</em>. Something <em>worth returning to</em>.</p><p>Because cities—like stories—only matter when they make you want to return.</p>
