    <p>We live in a time when people are desperate to understand themselves — but more often than not, the tools handed to them don’t just simplify, they flatten. They tell you who you are with a confident icon: <em>You are the Architect. You are the Protagonist.</em> A sword, a robe, a diagram of strengths and weaknesses. Your personality becomes a badge, a performance. Your identity, a fixed role in a psychological play.</p>
    <p>But what if that’s not how we’re meant to know ourselves?</p>
    <p>What if true understanding isn’t found in being told who you are — but in being gently invited to become who you already are, with God’s design beneath?</p>
    <p>At Bodin, we believe no one is the architect of their mind. God is the architect — we are the ones learning how to live within the structure He designed. And that structure isn’t static. It isn’t a job title or an aesthetic. It’s a configuration. A pattern. A sketch. Not a fixed character profile, but a quietly forming grid — like clouds that shift shape but are made of something eternal.</p>
    <p>We intentionally reject personality archetypes and color-coded typing. Not because personality isn’t real — but because it’s too real, too holy, to be reduced to a trope. Systems like MBTI might mean well, but their popular execution has become theatrical. Protagonists with swords. Architects in ivory towers. Extroverts always leading the room. Introverts always hiding in corners. It creates a fantasy — one that’s easy to adopt, but hard to grow within.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest distortions comes from the fixation on Introversion vs. Extroversion. In today’s culture, that has become the takeaway. No one talks about how you process information (sensing vs. intuition), or how you evaluate the world (thinking vs. feeling). They focus on how “social” you are. And it quickly becomes tribal: introverts are deep and superior, extroverts are loud and shallow. Or vice versa.</p>
    <p>But this binary collapses under real life.<br>During the pandemic, during the Great Resignation, we watched as extroverts — people who had never valued solitude — suddenly found themselves forced into reflection. And something happened. They changed. They <em>grew</em>. They discovered that solitude wasn’t isolation — it was revelation. That being alone wasn’t a weakness — it was a mirror.</p>
    <p>Everyone needs reflection.<br>Everyone needs solitude.<br>To categorize energy — to tell someone that because they’re “51% extrovert” they don’t need stillness — is not just reductive. It’s destructive. It’s a denial of the full spectrum of human cognition and spiritual need.</p>
    <p>At Bodin, we’ve created a system that does the opposite.<br>It doesn’t feed you a character.<br>It doesn’t color your identity.<br>It gives you a configuration — a cognitive sketch. Quiet, neutral, respectful. It places the responsibility on you to explore, reflect, and learn how your mind <em>moves</em> — not what category it fits into.</p>
    <p>And as the world shifts — as culture changes, as people seek meaning beyond algorithmic identity — we are paying attention.<br>Bodin isn’t static. It evolves.<br>Not because truth changes, but because our understanding of it deepens.</p>
    <p>We don’t offer spectacle. We offer clarity.<br>We don’t shout type names. We whisper structure.<br>We don’t create characters. We reveal cognition.</p>
    <p>And in all of this, we never forget:<br>We are not the architects.<br>We are the ones being drawn.</p>
