            <p>There’s something eerie about the silence before a storm. Not a natural one—no gale winds or thunderclouds—but something quieter and more invisible. Artificial Intelligence is coming soon. Not in the abstract way we’ve been hearing for decades, but in a real, foundational shift that will define the next era of civilization. And yet, we drift.</p><p>What unsettles me most isn't the technology itself. It's the world it's about to collide with: a society already unraveling at the seams of meaning. I currently live in an environment like this—one where time seems to dissolve under the weight of affluence and inertia. In places with an abundance of public holidays, where every subculture is given space to pause, what emerges is not celebration, but stasis. The days blur together, filled with consumption and leisure. In affluent neighborhoods, you see people with infinite means looping through shopping centers in luxury cars, not because they need anything, but because they don’t know where else to go. And I began to realize: I’m not just observing a class dynamic. I’m witnessing a simulation of the future.</p><p>In many parts of Southeast Asia and cities like Dubai, I observe societies gaining affluence at an unnatural pace—faster than the long, layered evolution of Western economies. These societies often rely heavily on migrant labor to handle the responsibilities of daily life. Locals no longer cook, clean, build, or drive. Their lives are buffered by a service class that allows them to float, responsibility-free. How is that fundamentally different from a world dependent on AI? And if this is the prototype of a society cushioned from effort, what does it tell us about where we’re heading? Because when you look closer, these cultures aren’t hotbeds of innovation. They’re not producing new systems, philosophies, or technologies. They’re relaxing. They’re sunbathing. They’re killing time.</p><p>What disappears first in these environments is urgency. Urgency comes from responsibility—when you’re accountable for the outcome of your own existence. But in a culture built on outsourcing everything, that sense of responsibility dissolves. And when urgency vanishes, so does direction. So does purpose. So do principles. What’s left is consumption. Endless, ambient consumption. Entertainment replacing inquiry. Spectacle replacing growth.</p><p>Now imagine AI arriving into <em>that</em> world.</p><p>AI is not a novelty. It’s not a smarter Google or a fun assistant. It is the backend of the new world. It will touch labor, identity, culture, even morality. And most people are preparing for it like it’s an amusement ride. They marvel at it, post screenshots of clever replies, use it to polish emails, but very few are engaging with it seriously—learning how it works, how to work with it, or how to orient their lives around its emergence.</p><p>The real catastrophe won’t be explosive. It’ll be quiet. It’ll be spiritual. Because a society with no compass—armed with limitless synthetic intelligence—won’t rise. It will erode. Slowly. Painlessly. Until we’ve outsourced not just our labor but our minds, our decisions, and our ability to imagine.</p><p>What’s coming isn’t just a technological revolution. It’s a confrontation with the void. And if we don’t reclaim urgency—if we don’t rebuild a culture of responsibility, depth, and direction—we will arrive at the future not as participants, but as passive spectators of our own descent.</p><p>Coming soon.</p>
