    <p>We are already cybernetic. Not in body — in behavior.</p>
    <p>There’s a scene in <em>The Matrix</em> where Morpheus shows Neo the truth: human beings, grown — not born — in rows upon rows of artificial wombs. Suspended, unconscious, harvested for their energy. To the machines, human life has been reduced to a simple function: a battery. When it came out, that scene read like science fiction. But it wasn’t prophecy. It was diagnosis.</p>
    <p>Because that is exactly where we are now.</p>
    <p>Not with wires in our backs or plugs in our heads.<br>It’s the rectangle we hold in our hands.</p>
    <p>The algorithm is the field. And we are already being grown in it — not to serve life, but to feed systems that profit from attention, not intention.</p>
    <p>What we call “content creation” today is little more than energy extraction. The system doesn’t care what you feel — only that you feel <em>something</em>. Anything. The louder, the faster, the more visceral, the better. The algorithm surfaces what performs, and what performs is what provokes. Not what nourishes. Not what builds. Just what hooks.</p>
    <p>And once the rules of visibility are built around that logic, culture itself begins to mutate. Thought collapses into reaction. Discourse becomes spectacle. Art becomes bait. And the people creating it change, too — often without even realizing. They begin to optimize for reach instead of truth, for recognition instead of resonance. Identity becomes content. Expression becomes performance. Authenticity becomes a brand.</p>
    <p>This isn’t a conspiracy. It’s a consequence.<br>And it’s cognitive.</p>
    <p>Because once you understand that the majority of the global population leans toward external stimulation, sensory input, and immediate reward, you begin to see how the algorithm was never neutral. It’s tuned to serve that dominant cognitive style. So the system doesn’t just distract — it <em>manipulates</em>. It creates a self-reinforcing loop that trains people to become shallower versions of themselves. The more you think in short bursts, the more you’re rewarded. The more complex your ideas, the more invisible you become.</p>
    <p>This doesn’t just crowd out meaningful content — it structurally <em>blocks</em> it. Anyone with real insight, depth, or conceptual clarity becomes unshareable, unreadable, unreachable. And that’s not a bug in the system. That’s the system doing exactly what it was built to do: amplify what performs, and erase what requires thought. It punishes cognition. It punishes critical thinking. Because the system doesn’t want us to think. It doesn’t want reflection. It wants compliance. Distraction. Passive engagement. The moment you start questioning — really questioning — you become friction in a machine that runs on silence.</p>
    <p>And this is how we end up with a podcast where someone like Theo Von — who doesn’t even know how to conduct an interview — sits across from Mark Zuckerberg and calls him one of the greatest minds of our time. That’s all you need to know.</p>
