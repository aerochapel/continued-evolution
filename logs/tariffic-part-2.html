            <p><strong>The Right vs. The Left: A Disconnect from Production</strong></p><p>The key difference between the right and the left, if we look at it from a geographic perspective, is where they live and what industries they are connected to. Republicans tend to reside in more rural areas, where they are more closely tied to industries like farming, steel mills, manufacturing plants, and food production. These communities are directly involved in the production of goods, giving them a clearer understanding of the labor and resources required to make those products. This hands-on connection fosters a deeper appreciation for supporting local goods and national manufacturing. For many on the right, consuming locally made products isn’t just an economic choice—it’s about maintaining a relationship with the labor, resources, and communities that produce them.</p><p>In contrast, many Democrats live in urban areas, often along the coasts, where their daily lives revolve around conveniences like food delivery services, technology, and consumer goods. Ironically, even though these coastal cities are near major shipping ports, where containers arrive daily from overseas, the people living there are often completely disconnected from the process. Their lives are removed from the complexities of global trade and the ethical implications of the products they consume. While they may advocate for inclusivity and environmental sustainability, their views on consumer goods are often shaped by convenience, overlooking the environmental cost of importing goods and the unethical manufacturing practices abroad. Their view of consumer products can seem as though they "fall out of the sky," disconnected from the real-world processes that bring them to their doorsteps.</p><hr><p><strong>Encouraging Reflection on Consumption</strong></p><p>Tariffs compel people to reflect on their consumption. For example, take blueberries. In my country, blueberries imported from South Africa, Peru, and Chile are expensive due to tariffs. While some might initially feel frustrated by the higher prices, it forces consumers to question: Do we really need imported blueberries when seasonal, locally grown produce would suffice? The tariff turns what might seem like an inconvenience into an opportunity for deeper reflection.</p><p>Without the global distribution system and high import taxes, most people wouldn’t consume out-of-season blueberries. The higher price tag forces us to confront nature’s cycles more directly, encouraging us to value local agriculture and seasonality over the convenience of global supply chains. This isn’t just about economic efficiency—it’s a mindset change. Instead of viewing the tariff as an obstacle, consumers begin to reconsider how their purchasing decisions impact local industries and national production.</p><hr><p><strong>A Tool for Cultural Change</strong></p><p>At its core, tariffs are not just an economic decision; they’re a tool for shaping consumption. By narrowing choices, we are encouraged to focus on what we can produce locally—whether it’s food, cars, or other goods. This results in a more self-sufficient country, less dependent on global markets.</p><hr><p><strong>The Trade War Worry</strong></p><p>Many people worry about trade wars triggered by tariffs, fearing negative economic consequences. But what’s the worst that can happen? Compared to global threats like nuclear warfare or potential invasions, trade wars seem far less dangerous. If other countries retaliate with their own tariffs, the result is a temporary strain on prices and trade relationships. However, this pressure could ultimately encourage more domestic manufacturing, which would benefit long-term economic stability. Increased domestic production would create jobs, foster self-sufficiency, and strengthen local industries. A trade war might not be ideal, but it's a much less dangerous scenario than the geopolitical threats we face. It’s a win-win for the country in the long run.</p><hr><p><strong>Peace Through Strength</strong></p><p>What I also admire about Trump’s stance is his principle of <strong>peace through strength</strong>, which is clearly being implemented here. His actions, although often criticized by the left, reflect a strategic approach that promotes peace by strengthening the country from within. For example, in response to the fentanyl crisis that has plagued the U.S., particularly from Mexico, Trump’s tariffs serve as a diplomatic, measured reaction to the chaos caused by cartel influence. While many might argue that his policies are reactionary, they are, in fact, a calculated way to protect the country without resorting to militaristic tactics to combat cartels or further escalate violence. It’s an intelligent and, in many ways, more humane response to the long-term challenges created by illegal drug trade and trafficking, and it also strengthens America’s economic position at home.</p><hr><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Ultimately, tariffs are terrific for some and not so terrific for others. They serve as a reminder that sometimes, a little constraint can lead to greater reflection and a more mindful approach to consumption. Instead of resenting higher costs, we can embrace them as an opportunity to reorient ourselves around more sustainable, locally focused values. Tariffs force consumers to reconsider what is necessary and what might be extraneous.</p><p>What I appreciate about Republican policies is their use of common sense and critical thinking. While sometimes seen as controversial by the left, many of their actions, even when indirectly criticized, yield improvements in areas like the environment, geopolitical conflicts, and national sustainability. These policies—like tariffs—often achieve positive outcomes without the fanfare they deserve. Their focus on practical, sometimes tough decisions can lead to solutions that benefit the nation, even if it’s not immediately obvious.</p><hr><p><strong>Please note</strong>: As I finished up this essay, Canada's Prime Minister announced retaliatory tariffs of 25% on U.S. goods in response to Trump’s implementation of tariffs. While many worry about the worst-case scenario in trade wars, what's the worst that can happen? The U.S. can focus on building its own manufacturing and becoming more autonomous, less dependent on other countries. This should reinforce long-term strength and independence.</p>
