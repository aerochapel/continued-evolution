            <p>If the developing world offers a simulation of what life looks like when affluence and direction part ways, the West paints a darker, more fractured picture. In this part of the world, affluence isn’t the problem—fragmentation is. As AI draws closer, we must recognize that what’s truly coming isn’t just automation. It’s acceleration into a future where no one is prepared—not culturally, not psychologically, and certainly not structurally.</p><p>In the West, we’re not drifting—we’re splintering. Cohesion has collapsed under the weight of forced multiculturalism, where shared values have been traded for shallow inclusion. What once bound communities—tradition, nationhood, religion, family—has been methodically unraveled. And now we’re left with a native class, once foundational, now dissolving. Divorce, fatherless homes, and generational instability have broken the family unit. The result? A population without grounding. Without discipline. Without structure.</p><p>Young people, raised in this vacuum, are being educated in systems that haven’t been updated in decades. Schools cling to outdated curricula while the world races ahead. Teachers have no authority, classrooms have no order, and the last place a child finds community is often in school. So they look elsewhere—for belonging, for validation, for identity. They find it in gang culture, in hyper-individualism, in online echo chambers. They trade direction for dopamine.</p><p>Meanwhile, our institutions seem oblivious. Nations like the UK fixate on external narratives—climate optics, foreign politics, virtue signaling—while ignoring the quiet, incremental collapse of their own people. We have directionless youth and directionless elderly. Those with wealth will taper out their lives comfortably, buffered from the chaos. But those without—especially those already raised in broken homes, educated by broken systems, and surrounded by broken values—will be hit the hardest when AI arrives.</p><p>Because AI won’t come politely. It will come efficiently. It will remove jobs with precision, particularly the ones that required little skill but provided critical structure: delivery, driving, warehouse, service work, entry-level desk jobs. These aren’t just jobs—they’re social stabilizers. When they vanish, what remains?</p><p>Untamed energy. Boredom. Rage. Disorder.</p><p>And we’re already seeing flickers of this future. Vandalism is being rebranded as protest. The destruction of private property is now considered noble if it targets the “right” people. Influencers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5o5kW678nU&amp;ref=aerochapel.com" rel="noreferrer">Brian Tyler Cohen</a>—followed by millions—frame the burning of Teslas as justified retaliation for layoffs. As if destroying someone’s car is morally equivalent to corporate restructuring. When this kind of moral confusion becomes mainstream, the problem isn’t the technology—it’s us.</p><p>Just like a weapon doesn’t pull its own trigger, AI won’t destroy society on its own. It’s who wields it. And right now, we have millions of emotionally unstable, spiritually lost, unprincipled individuals being handed the most powerful tools in human history. We don’t need better machines. We need better people.</p><p>You see it everywhere—the inability to form lasting relationships, the breakdown of intimacy, the fear and distrust between men and women. AI will offer a “solution” to that too. Emotional surrogates. Simulated companionship. Perfect partners with no friction. But that kind of convenience will be catastrophic. It will only deepen the fracture, feeding loneliness with illusion. Human relationships aren’t supposed to be easy—they’re supposed to be real.</p><p>So what do we do?</p><p>We build principles. We define limits. We teach structure. We return to the idea of a higher power—something moral, spiritual, unchanging—that can override the chaos. Because this isn’t about AI. It never was. The threat isn’t artificial intelligence. The threat is the absence of wisdom, of leadership, of restraint. The technology is neutral. The culture is not.</p><p>What’s coming is not a technical revolution—it’s a moral reckoning. If we don’t prepare, we’re not going to evolve. We’re going to burn. The only way out is forward, and the only way forward is to reorient the next generation—right now. That means reimagining education, not around obedience or compliance, but around cognition. Around helping young people understand themselves, their strengths, and how to apply those strengths in places where AI <em>can’t</em> go. Physicality. Meaning. Humanity. Vision.</p><p>The future needs a map. And it needs mapmakers.</p><p>Coming soon.</p>
