    <p>But this distortion didn’t start with social media. It began with the internet itself.</p>
    <p>There was a time — not so long ago — when the internet was a space for floating ideas. It was conceptual. Experimental. Messy in the right way. A place where frameworks were tested, knowledge was shared, and obscure insights had room to breathe. Back then, it wasn’t something the average person used to be entertained. In fact, the people now most addicted to the system — those driven by external stimulation and sensory input — wanted little to do with the internet. It was too abstract. Too slow. Too thought-driven.</p>
    <p>And it wasn’t just what people said — it was what they built.</p>
    <p>There was a time when the internet was colorful. Messy. Unique. Every page had its own look, its own experiment. Some were elegant. Some were unreadable. But each one reflected the mind of its maker. There was personality. Risk. Exploration. The design itself was part of the idea.</p>
    <p>Now? Everything looks like Squarespace.<br>Rounded corners. Neutral tones. Grid layouts.<br>Why?</p>
    <p>That didn’t just “happen.” It wasn’t a mystery. It was cognition.</p>
    <p>Because when you have a dominant cognitive type — one rooted in sensory clarity, repetition, and immediate reward — that becomes the design language of the world. It’s not just about taste. It’s about <em>neural preference</em>. A sensor-dominant population doesn’t want complexity. It doesn’t want experimentation. It wants what’s familiar. What’s smooth. What’s already been validated. And over time, platforms that cater to that aesthetic — like Facebook — become the only internet some people even recognize. In parts of Southeast Asia, entire populations literally thought Facebook <em>was</em> the internet. That’s not a tech problem. That’s a cognitive signal.</p>
    <p>And that’s why real diversity — <strong>cognitive diversity</strong> — is the missing piece in all of this.</p>
    <p>We hear so much about diversity from progressive institutions. But what good is diversity if everyone thinks the same? If all our perceptions, judgments, and internal structures are flattened to serve one cognitive model — the one that rewards speed, surface, and sameness? That’s not diversity. That’s entropy. That’s collapse.</p>
    <p>The argument is always, “Well, niche thinkers and artists still exist.” And they do. But niche isn’t the point. <strong>Those voices should be the focal point.</strong> Not because they’re superior — but because they’re expansive. They open new doors. They reorient perspective. They teach us to see.</p>
