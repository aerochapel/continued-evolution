    <p>And I say that from experience.</p>
    <p>I’ve lived in different countries. Stepped outside of the cultural box I was given. Not to escape, but to <em>see</em>. To coalesce perspectives. To discover what’s universal, and what’s conditioning. And all of that gets injected into the things I create. The life I live. The ideas I share. I don’t just sit there bashing the same button like a monkey addicted to bananas — when there are durians, mangosteens, jackfruit, things I’ve never even tasted before. That’s the point of being alive. <em>To explore different fruits.</em> Not just keep pressing for the sugar you’ve been trained to expect.</p>
    <p>And that’s the tragedy of a world driven by the algorithm:<br>It doesn’t just make us predictable.<br>It makes the unknown invisible.</p>
    <p>And here’s the deeper tragedy: we’ve become <em>nameless</em>.</p>
    <p>The content doesn’t just extract our energy — it <em>erases our memory</em>. That’s why there are no household names anymore. We’re producing more than ever, and yet nobody remembers who made what. You can go on Instagram right now, find the artist with the most followers or likes per post — and the average person on the street won’t even know their name. Because this system doesn’t cultivate legacy. It chews people up as content-delivery devices.</p>
    <p>And you can feel it in reality. Not just online — in your own body, in the way people relate.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just digital distortion. It’s emotional. Spiritual. Because when we strip creators of their identity — when we treat posts, images, performances as disposable hits — we’re not just being extracted <em>from</em>. We’re extracting <em>from each other</em>. Everyone becomes a quick fix for someone else’s boredom. No context. No conversation. No memory. Just dopamine. Swipe. Next.</p>
    <p>It’s why someone can create something beautiful, moving, or deeply original — and vanish. No one remembers them. And it’s not just content. It’s conversation. It’s social life. Small talk. Shallow interaction. We no longer ask <em>why</em> we’re disconnected — we only argue over <em>what</em> divides us. And so we drift. Alone, overstimulated, and starving for real connection.</p>
    <p>And I’ll say this personally, because I’ve lived it:<br>From the very beginning, I never trusted it. When Facebook launched, back in the early 2000s, everyone around me told me to join. “Promote yourself,” they said. “You need to be on social media.” But my instincts said otherwise. Deep down, I could see through it — through Zuckerberg, through the platform, through the entire idea. Even the name <em>Facebook</em> exposed the shallowness of its premise: reducing humans to a face in a book. No complexity. No context. No soul.</p>
    <p>It was the same thing when I said I was leaving Europe for Japan. “Why would you do that?” they asked. “Why not stay in the West?” And now, what do we see? Europe’s crumbling. Japan’s one of the most desired destinations on the planet. You don’t make those decisions by following trends. You make them by listening to something deeper — your intuition.</p>
    <p>And now that I understand my own cognitive architecture, I know why that instinct always worked. Intuition is how I perceive the world. When I lean into it, I get the best results. When I don’t, I get the worst. But that kind of knowing — that inner structure — can’t emerge in a system that suppresses lenses like intuition. And that’s what this system does. It erodes our ability to know ourselves by default.</p>
