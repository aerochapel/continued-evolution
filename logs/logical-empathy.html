            <p>One of the biggest struggles I have with Christianity is that it doesn’t seem built for people like me—people who think in systems, who need coherence to believe, who show care by asking questions. The whole structure leans sentimental. You're told to love your neighbor, to serve, to sacrifice—but no one talks about the fact that you can't care for others unless you're stable yourself. If you're not, you become a burden. And ambition—the very thing that could lead to that stability—is quietly treated like ego.</p><p>It’s similar in progressive ideology. There's this undercurrent that not trying too hard is somehow more virtuous. That stepping back and letting everyone in is morally superior. But the people who say that are usually the ones who’ve already made it. They’ve built platforms, monetized their voices, published books, scaled audiences. They’ve used capitalism to rise—and now they preach against it, as if their success came purely from virtue or empathy. But that’s not how influence works. You don’t get heard by accident. You get heard by playing the game better than most.</p><p>Capitalism is the operating system, whether we like it or not. And the people who gain a voice in this world—whether progressive or religious—have done so by succeeding within that system. Writing a book? That’s capitalism. Launching a podcast? That’s capitalism. Building a brand, monetizing a message, competing for attention? All capitalism. So when someone stands on a capitalist-built platform and denounces it, it rings hollow. The method contradicts the message.</p><p>Look at someone like Rachel Maddow. She earns $25 million a year to do one show a week. She promotes empathy and systemic critique—through a structure that pays her that much because she’s part of the market machine. She’s not outside the system—she <em>is</em> the system. And yet, the narrative is that people like her are morally superior to someone like Trump or Musk—figures who at least acknowledge that the world runs on competition, profit, and performance. The Republican mindset doesn't pretend otherwise. It says: life is a business. If you want to survive, act like a businessman. It’s harsh, but at least it’s honest.</p><p>Christianity, meanwhile, gets caught trying to live between the two poles—preaching sacrifice and stability, conviction and compassion. It tells you to welcome everyone, but also to reject sin. But what happens when those convictions clash with someone else’s identity or values? What if caring for someone pulls you away from your values? What if including them means compromising what you believe? These questions don’t have clean answers—but they also don’t have space in the current conversation. Because inclusivity has become the format, and questioning doesn’t fit the format.</p><p>When I became a Christian, it wasn’t because I heard a voice. It wasn’t some supernatural moment. It was like my conscience had been upgraded—a hypersensitivity to right and wrong, like the protective casing around my heart had been peeled back. That’s what faith has felt like to me. Not loud, not performative—quiet, personal, and deeply responsible. And with that heightened sensitivity comes accountability. You can’t participate in environments that feel chaotic, transactional, or shallow. That inner shift makes it harder to go with the flow when the flow doesn’t feel right.</p><p>But when you try to express that, even in church, you’re often met with confusion—or worse, dismissal. Because while everyone’s enjoying the sandwiches provided by a kind volunteer, the last thing they want to talk about is your 60,000-foot question about the structural integrity of Christian faith. And nobody wants to go there. It’s not part of the narrative. Just like in politics—try telling a progressive that their outrage at Tesla is ironic given their reliance on tech, and you’ll be ignored. The questions don’t fit the room, so the room just shrugs them off.</p><p>But if you think in systems, you see the inconsistencies immediately. You assess ideologies like frameworks. You scan for potholes. And when you notice them repeating, again and again, you can’t just unsee them. You can’t jump on board with anything that’s riddled with contradictions, no matter how virtuous the message sounds. For someone like me, that’s not stubbornness—it’s integrity. Thinking deeply is how I love.</p><p>And that’s the part people miss. For analytical minds, empathy doesn’t always come with tears or hugs—it comes with logic. With clarity. With trying to understand someone so fully that your response becomes more accurate, more intentional, more meaningful. AI does this too. It learns who you are through patterns. Its version of compassion isn’t emotional—it’s structural. And people like me function that way too. We don’t broadcast empathy. We build systems around it.</p><p>So when I question Christianity, or politics, or culture—it’s not because I’m trying to tear anything down. It’s because I care enough to want it to make sense. To be coherent. To be something I can live inside, not just agree with publicly. And when none of the major systems—faith, politics, morality—offer that clarity, it becomes deeply isolating.</p><p>I don’t reject Christianity. I take it seriously. That’s why I question it. That’s why I don’t just show up on Sunday and call that faith. Because for someone like me, faith has to hold up under scrutiny—or it doesn’t hold at all. And if that makes me difficult, maybe it’s not me who’s lost. Maybe the systems we’ve inherited just weren’t built for people like me.</p>
