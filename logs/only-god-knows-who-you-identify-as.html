            <p>Imagine standing in a supermarket, looking at a head of broccoli wrapped tightly in plastic. The cling film creates an image of perfection—pristine, marketable, and ready for purchase. But this is not the broccoli’s true identity. Its essence lies in the seed it grew from, the soil that nurtured it, and the sun and rain that allowed it to flourish.</p><p>Not only has this broccoli been sprayed with pesticides and likely grown in polluted soil, but it has also been severed from its source. It has been cut off from the other heads of broccoli it grew alongside, part of a larger plant. The cling film and individual packaging serve to isolate it further, turning what was once connected and whole into a product stripped of its natural context.</p><p>This journey of disconnection mirrors the way humanity is shaped by the world today. Just as the broccoli is wrapped and polished for consumer appeal, people are wrapped in societal labels—our careers, financial status, gender, or social roles. These labels create a marketable, acceptable version of who we are, but they obscure our true identity, the essence of who God created us to be.</p><p>In many ways, we’ve become a commercialized product of God’s truth and purity, repackaged to fit an environment built on parameters that are completely upside down in logic. These parameters, dictated by societal values and consumer-driven culture, are often in direct opposition to the divine principles of the Creator.</p><h3 id="triple-wrapped-in-cling-film">Triple-Wrapped in Cling Film</h3><p>This distortion is magnified in the realm of social media. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok wrap us in additional layers of curated content and filtered appearances. Social media thrives on appearances, fostering a need for external validation based on likes, views, and comments.</p><p>But this need for worldly validation is a dangerous trap. It shifts our focus away from Christ, the true source of identity, and onto fleeting, superficial metrics. Instead of seeking to be known by God, we seek to be noticed by the world.</p><p>As John 12:43 says:<br><strong>"For they loved human praise more than praise from God."</strong></p><p>Social media nurtures this misplaced desire, encouraging us to live for the approval of others rather than for the approval of Christ. The more we seek validation from the world, the further we stray from our true identity in Him.</p><h3 id="the-irony-of-modern-identity">The Irony of Modern Identity</h3><p>Over time, we have become so disconnected from the essence of who we are that when the world offers a "big reveal" of someone’s true identity, it is often far removed from their authentic self. In modern culture, this has become a recurring theme. The polished, commercialized version of a person often masks the essence of who they are—leaving us with something shallow and performative rather than authentic.</p><p>This phenomenon isn’t limited to individuals. It extends to creations, organizations, and even nations. Consider a city like Dubai, renowned for its glittering glass monoliths and sprawling luxury. On the surface, it presents a veneer of success, progress, and wealth. Yet, this image is built on the backs of migrant workers who endure poor conditions and unethical practices. The structures themselves may look pristine, but their foundation is anything but sustainable or virtuous.</p><p>This mindset—focused on appearances rather than essence—isn’t confined to one part of the world. As someone who has lived abroad, I have witnessed this pattern repeat itself in Asia. Nations there, particularly in their rapidly developing cities, are modeling the same procedures for success that Western cultures have already gone through. They chase after the same industrialization, urbanization, and consumerism, believing it to be the hallmark of a developed society.</p><p>What is shocking, however, is the lack of foresight. The West’s journey has already shown us the cost of these behaviors—environmental degradation, societal division, and a loss of deeper meaning and connection. Yet these nations appear eager to climb the same ladder without questioning whether the destination is worth it.</p><p>Worse still, this replication is happening in an even more exaggerated form because we live in an era of amplified superficiality. Social media and globalization have accelerated the need to present a polished façade, not just for individuals but for entire countries. What could have been an opportunity for nations on the first rung of the ladder to do things differently has instead turned into a race to emulate the mistakes of others.</p><h3 id="man-made-good-vs-god%E2%80%99s-truth">Man-Made Good vs. God’s Truth</h3><p>Society often measures goodness and success by external achievements—financial wealth, career accomplishments, or social influence. But these measures are as superficial as the cling film wrapped around the broccoli. They create an illusion of perfection while obscuring the truth.</p><p>Consider someone running a profitable business, like a casino. They may be seen as successful because they can support their family. Yet, the very nature of their work perpetuates harm by encouraging addictive behaviors. Similarly, social media executives profit from platforms designed to exploit human psychology, even as they protect their own families from the effects of these systems.</p><p>These examples reveal the gap between man-made good and God’s truth. The world sees success and virtue based on appearances, but God sees the heart. As 1 Samuel 16:7 reminds us:<br><strong>"The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."</strong></p><p>God doesn’t judge us by our outward achievements or societal labels. He looks beyond the cling film, the polluted soil, and the pesticides. He sees our essence and our intentions.</p><h3 id="disconnected-from-the-source">Disconnected from the Source</h3><p>When we wrap ourselves in societal labels or seek validation through social media, we disconnect from the source of our true identity—God. The internet, which once promised connection and creativity, has become a noisy, shallow space where people compete for attention. The depth and authenticity that once characterized meaningful interaction have been replaced by quick, surface-level exchanges.</p><p>This obsession with external validation erodes not only our attention spans but also our ability to connect with the spiritual realm. When we prioritize appearances and validation over truth and depth, we lose the capacity to engage with God and the unseen.</p><p>As Matthew 6:19-20 reminds us:<br><strong>"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal."</strong></p><h3 id="true-identity-in-christ">True Identity in Christ</h3><p>Just as the broccoli’s true essence lies in its seed and soil—not in its cling film—our true identity lies in Christ, not in societal labels or achievements. God doesn’t judge us by the roles we play or the accomplishments we collect. He judges us by our hearts and the fruit we bear in the world.</p><p>When we align our lives with Christ, we strip away the cling film of labels, expectations, and external validation. We reconnect with the essence of who we were created to be.</p><h3 id="conclusion-only-god-knows-who-you-identify-as">Conclusion: Only God Knows Who You Identify As</h3><p>In a world that prizes outward appearances, it’s easy to lose sight of what truly matters. But God sees beyond the cling film, beyond the pesticides, beyond the polluted soil. He sees our hearts, our intentions, and our essence.</p><p>The question isn’t, “What does the world see in you?” but “What does God see in you?” Society’s standards of success and goodness are fleeting and shallow. True identity comes from living a life rooted in Christ, reflecting His love, and seeking His validation above all else.</p><p>Let us strip away the cling film, reject the noise of social media, and embrace the truth that our worth lies not in how we are perceived but in how we are known by God. For in the end, only His judgment matters, and only He knows our true identity.</p>
