            <p>As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, migration has taken on a new form—one that goes beyond economics and extends into identity, aspiration, and cultural continuity. Historically, migration was often tied to purpose: people left their home countries to fill labor gaps, contribute to new industries, or engage in structured roles abroad, such as teaching, engineering, or research. Today, however, migration flows are often unstructured and disconnected, leading to an erosion of national identities and a fragmentation of societies that were once bound by shared values and collective purpose.</p><p>England is a prime example of this phenomenon. After disconnecting itself from Europe through Brexit, one might have expected the country to strengthen its own identity, to become more cohesive, and to reclaim a sense of national purpose. Instead, the opposite has happened. Rather than consolidating its culture, values, and future direction, England has diluted itself, resembling a glass of Coke that has been overfilled with ice—once distinct in flavor, now watered down to the point where its essence is barely recognizable.</p><p>The country faces a paradox: it has sought sovereignty but lacks a clear sense of self. At the same time that it has pushed away its European ties, it has struggled to integrate large waves of migration in a way that fosters cohesion rather than fragmentation. The UK’s policies have allowed vast demographic shifts without an emphasis on assimilation, creating a nation where people coexist but do not necessarily connect. The result is an increasingly divided society—one where there is no clear common culture, direction, or identity, but rather a scattering of disconnected communities with differing values, goals, and expectations.</p><p>This is not about nationalism or shutting down migration—it’s about structured, intentional migration that aligns with a country’s trajectory. England, like many other Western nations, has seen large numbers of its highly skilled workers leaving for countries that offer greater autonomy and opportunity. These are individuals who have clear objectives—whether it’s building businesses, working in research, or contributing to industries where they are valued. Their migration has purpose.</p><p>However, the country simultaneously experiences an influx of people whose roles, contributions, and alignment with the national fabric are undefined. When migration happens for the sake of movement rather than integration, it creates a hollow society—one where people share physical space but not collective purpose. This lack of continuity means that rather than becoming stronger as a nation, England has become weaker, more fragmented, and less certain of what it actually stands for.</p>
