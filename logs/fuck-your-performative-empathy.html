            <p>In a recent Fox News interview, Elon Musk said:</p><blockquote><em>“I take great offense at those who put the appearance of goodness over the reality of it... those who virtue signal while wars continue and people lose their lives.”</em></blockquote><p>That statement wasn’t just about politics — it was about cognition. About the mental split that defines not just our parties, but our entire culture.</p><p>On one side, you have people who think <em>objectively</em> — who judge the world based on outcomes, logic, and consequence. On the other, you have people who <em>feel</em> their way through decisions — the kind of people who send you a greetings card once a year and never see you the whole year — who value emotion, empathy, and appearances, even if the results are catastrophic. That is the real divide between the two parties. Not policy. Not class. <em>Cognition.</em></p><p>The Democratic Party has become a shrine to on-brand empathy — a packaged, performative virtue that sells well in Whole Foods and gets retweeted by late-night talk show hosts, but never actually <em>helps</em> anyone. It’s all theater. All surface. They create the <em>appearance</em> of compassion, the <em>illusion</em> of caring, while their actions betray a complete lack of responsibility, foresight, or consistency.</p><p>They say they care about peace — while supporting endless foreign interventions that kill civilians overseas.<br>They say they care about the environment — while cheering on mobs that torch electric cars in the name of moral outrage.<br>They say they care about the vulnerable — while running cities where crime, poverty, and mental illness are ignored, dismissed, or excused.</p><p>Let’s talk about those Teslas.</p><p>There is no greater irony than someone burning an electric car as a political protest. And yet that’s exactly what’s happened — multiple times. But they’re not doing it because of climate change. They’re doing it because Elon Musk is affiliated with Donald Trump — and because they’ve been indoctrinated into believing that both men are evil dictators, worse than any dictator in history. Because Stephen Colbert said so.</p><p>Want to talk facts? Burning a single Tesla produces more CO₂ and toxic emissions than driving it for 50 to 100 years. Let that sink in. That one act of so-called “resistance” does more environmental damage than the car would have produced in a <em>lifetime</em> of clean, functional use.</p><p>And what happens to the burnt shell? Straight to the landfill. No second use. No benefit to anyone. No transportation for a low-income family. No emergency trips to the hospital. Just a pile of waste — all because some impressionable drone with zero critical thinking got caught up in a political tantrum, mimicking ideologies that were handcrafted in air-conditioned Hollywood green rooms and progressive newsrooms.</p><p>And why is that person impressionable? <em>Cognitive functions.</em><br>Not mental illness. Not some vague, manufactured reason.<br>Cognitive. Functions.</p><p>This is the cost of performative empathy. It <em>feels</em> right, so it <em>must</em> be right. That’s the cognitive flaw. And when this kind of emotional reasoning is scaled to the level of policy, law, and media, it doesn’t just inconvenience people — it destroys lives.</p><p>I’ve had my car stolen. A modest one — nothing flashy. But it was mine. And when it was taken, I saw the system up close: the police didn’t care. The prosecutors didn’t follow through. The people responsible never faced consequences. <em>There was no justice. None.</em></p><p>And to top it off, I had to pick up the charges. I had to cover the costs. I had to pay for the damage done to me — while everyone else laughed. Friends. Bystanders. Even people in positions of responsibility. Like it was some harmless joke. Some unfortunate inconvenience I should just “move on from.”</p><p>That experience gave me all the data I needed to understand one brutal truth:</p><p><strong>My country is an effing waste of time to live in.</strong></p><p>If a nation can’t even protect a law-abiding citizen — someone who works, pays taxes, follows the rules, contributes to society — then what exactly is the point? What are we upholding? A flag? A slogan? A system that pretends to care but won’t even lift a finger when your life is upended?</p><p>That moment — that hollow, humiliating moment — made one thing clear to me: <em>F</em>** my country.*</p><p>I’m going to move somewhere I actually resonate with the people. Somewhere I don’t have to pretend anymore. Somewhere that hasn't been completely overrun by people who value performance over principle, emotion over outcome, illusion over reality.</p><p>Multiply that across the country.</p><p>People losing their property, their safety, their trust in the system — while the media normalizes the behavior, reframes the facts, and tells you to be quiet if you disagree. Because if you question the narrative, you’re a threat. If you ask for accountability, you’re labeled a fascist. If you think logically — you’re “cold,” “inhuman,” “privileged.”</p><p>No — you’re <em>awake</em>.</p><p>This is what Elon Musk sees. What Trump — for all his flaws — has exposed. The rot isn’t in one policy or one party. It’s in the <em>performance</em> of care that substitutes for the <em>reality</em> of it. A mass psychosis of pretending to do good while the country burns — sometimes <em>literally.</em></p><p>And yet these people sleep at night, comfortably ensconced in their curated identities. Because as long as they look the part — as long as they tweet the right slogans, support the right causes, and perform empathy on cue — the damage doesn’t matter.</p><p>But they’re not kind.<br>They’re not thoughtful.<br>They’re the kind of people who would offer you a chocolate cake while your house is about to be decimated by a tornado — all while they’ve got a reinforced bunker beneath their own home, and not once think to invite you in.</p><p>That’s who we’re dealing with.</p><p>But the mask is slipping.</p><p>People are starting to see that a system built on feelings can’t solve real problems. That crying about injustice doesn’t fix it. That emotional reasoning doesn’t build infrastructure, doesn’t protect property, doesn’t hold up under pressure.</p><p>And the people selling you this branded, prepackaged morality?<br>They’re not even trying to help.<br>They’re trying to <em>feel good.</em><br>And they’ll burn everything down around you to keep that feeling intact.</p><p>So yes — <em>F</em>** your performative empathy.*</p><p>It’s not helping anyone.<br>It’s not saving the planet.<br>It’s not ending war.<br>It’s not healing the divide.</p><p>It’s making everything worse.</p><p>This isn’t left vs. right.<br>It’s <em>reality</em> vs. illusion.<br><em>Cognition</em> vs. performance.<br><em>Logic</em> vs. emotional narcissism.</p><p>And if we don’t start choosing reality — fast — there won’t be anything left to save.</p>
