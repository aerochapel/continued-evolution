            <p><strong>"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23)</strong></p><p>Years ago, I attended a concert in London to see a band that had profoundly influenced me. Comprising Aaron Turner, Aaron Harris, Jeff Caxide, Byron Clifford-Meyer, and Michael Gallagher, their music felt like something sacred—something that transcended the ordinary. I believed everyone in the crowd shared this same connection, but as the show unfolded, I noticed a small group behaving badly—creating chaos, pushing, and distracting from the music.</p><p>For a moment, I questioned my commitment to the band. I thought, "If these people are listening to the same music I love, why do they act this way? Does the fault lie in the music itself?" This sparked an internal battle, but as I looked around, I saw the majority of the audience deeply engaged, moved, and respectful. And I realized: the actions of a few could not taint the purity of the music. The music itself hadn’t changed; my connection to it hadn’t changed.</p><p>Years later, as a Christian, this memory resurfaced when people began challenging my faith. They pointed to flawed leaders, scandals, and the politics of religion as reasons to discredit Christianity. But just as my love for the music was not dependent on the behavior of others, my faith in Christ is not dependent on the Church, its leaders, or its politics. Faith, I’ve come to understand, is about something far deeper.</p><h3 id="faith-beyond-the-flaws">Faith Beyond the Flaws</h3><p>Faith should not be about the Church, bishops, priests, or the politics of Christianity. It should not rest on the imperfect foundation of man. Faith can only come from your own heart and your individual perception of Christ. That is the only truth you will ever know.</p><p>If your faith is built on human institutions or the capabilities of others, it will falter, because those capabilities will never match those of Jesus Christ. Humanity is flawed by nature. We are born in sin, and no bishop, priest, or institution will ever be able to embody the perfection of Christ. To rely on them as the foundation of your faith is to build on sand, not rock.</p><p>Christ’s perfection is the only unchanging foundation. It is not tied to the politics of religion or the errors of humanity. It is rooted in grace, love, and truth.</p><h3 id="the-limitations-of-earthly-critiques">The Limitations of Earthly Critiques</h3><p>When people criticize Christianity, they often do so from an earthly perspective, focusing on the visible flaws of its representatives. These critiques fail to acknowledge the spiritual essence of faith, much like the limitations described in <em>The Matrix</em>. Morpheus tells Neo:</p><blockquote><strong>"I won’t lie to you, Neo. Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, who has fought an Agent, has died. But where they failed, you will succeed."</strong></blockquote><p>Neo’s success lies in his ability to transcend the rules of the Matrix. Morpheus later explains:</p><blockquote><strong>"I’ve seen an Agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. Yet, their strength and speed are still based in a world built on rules. Because of that, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be."</strong></blockquote><p>Critiques of faith are similarly bound by the “rules” of the earthly realm. They cannot touch the spiritual truth of Christ because they are limited by human perception. The flaws of individuals may distort the faith in people’s eyes, but they do not alter the perfection of Christ.</p><h3 id="finding-and-expressing-our-essence">Finding and Expressing Our Essence</h3><p>As Christians, we have a responsibility to find our essence—the essence of who we are in Christ. This essence is the purest form of our connection with Him, unfiltered by the flaws of others or the distortions of the world. It is through this essence that we truly come to know Christ and reflect His perfection.</p><p>But this isn’t just about personal discovery—it’s also about expression. Once we find our essence in Christ, we are called to share it with the world. Whether through creative pursuits, acts of love, or simple kindness, we must communicate the purity of His perfection in a way that cannot be distorted by others.</p><p>The most important thing is that this essence comes from an authentic place. It must be rooted in our relationship with Christ, and it must be true to who we are in Him. When we express this essence honestly and unfiltered, it allows others to see Christ’s perfection—not through the flawed lens of humanity, but in its truest form.</p><h3 id="imperfectioneers-a-call-to-responsibility">Imperfectioneers: A Call to Responsibility</h3><p>We are imperfectioneers—flawed individuals striving to reflect the perfection of Christ. Our faith is not about the flaws of others or the politics of Christianity; it is about the essence of our connection with Christ.</p><p>As Christians, we have a responsibility to protect and nurture this essence within ourselves. By finding our true selves in Christ and expressing that essence to the world, we share His light in its purest form. In doing so, we fulfill our calling—to reflect Christ’s perfection to a world that desperately needs to see it.</p>
