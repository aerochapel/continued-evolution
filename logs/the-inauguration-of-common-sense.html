            <p><strong>"For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers." – Proverbs 11:14</strong></p><p>Today, January 20th, Donald Trump is being sworn in as the 47th President of the United States. For many, this moment represents a chance for America to return to principles that have been sorely missed in recent years: common sense and clarity. This isn’t just about Trump as an individual but about what his presidency might signify—the beginning of a shift back to foundational values rooted in wisdom and practicality.</p><p>As Christians, it’s easy to get caught up in the noise and polarization surrounding politics, but what if we looked at this moment differently? What if, instead of reacting with animosity or fear, we chose to see the hand of Jesus guiding this administration?</p><h3 id="a-springboard-for-a-new-generation">A Springboard for a New Generation</h3><p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Trump’s leadership is that his vibrant charisma provides a platform—a springboard—for a new generation of Republicans who might otherwise be overlooked by the mainstream media. Figures like Kristi Noem, Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy, and JD Vance are finally being noticed for their ideas and potential.</p><p>In a world where legacy media spends its energy glorifying figures like Kamala Harris, we’ve had to rely on platforms like Joe Rogan’s podcast for substantive conversations. While Rogan’s format is hardly comprehensive, it’s often the only avenue for these emerging leaders to share their vision. Trump’s presence, whether you support him or not, forces attention on those around him, making it possible for a broader range of voices to be heard.</p><h3 id="the-evidence-of-wisdom">The Evidence of Wisdom</h3><p>What makes this moment particularly significant isn’t just the personalities involved but the values they bring to the table. Common sense, as a guiding principle, is often rooted in the teachings of Jesus. His wisdom is evident in the people who prioritize accountability, empathy, and responsibility—values that can help mend the fractures in society.</p><p>For instance, recent forest fires in Los Angeles showed how apathy has eroded our ability to care for one another. There was an almost palpable indifference to the suffering of others simply because the fires affected wealthier areas. This lack of compassion highlights the dangers of a society that has strayed from the foundational values of loving one’s neighbor and working together for the common good.</p><h3 id="jesus-as-the-compass">Jesus as the Compass</h3><p>Jesus represents common sense—calm in the chaos, clarity in confusion. His teachings show us that growth comes not from division but from understanding, humility, and responsibility.</p><p>Some critics mock the idea that Trump’s presidency could be connected to these principles. But it’s not about Trump claiming to be Christ-like; it’s about recognizing that Christ works through unexpected people and circumstances. If this administration fosters values that align with Jesus’ teachings—restoring common sense, promoting accountability, and prioritizing unity—it’s a step in the right direction.</p><h3 id="a-call-for-hope">A Call for Hope</h3><p>This moment is not about blind loyalty to a political figure but about seizing the opportunity to restore common sense as a guiding principle. Whether it’s border policies that prioritize safety and order, or leaders who push back against the apathy that has consumed parts of Western civilization, this is a chance to reconnect with the fundamentals that have long been neglected.</p><p>As Trump takes office, we should pray that Jesus’ wisdom will guide this administration and shed light on the values that matter most. Common sense is more than a political tool—it’s a reflection of God’s wisdom, offering a path to peace and unity in a world that has often chosen chaos.</p><p>So instead of meeting this inauguration with hate or cynicism, let’s approach it with hope and faith. Let’s see it as an opportunity for Jesus to work through this moment, reminding us all of the power of common sense to rebuild, restore, and renew.</p>
