    <p><strong><em>"The problem today isn’t procrastination. It’s saturation."</em></strong></p>
  
    <p>I recently watched Joe Rogan’s interview with film director Robert Rodriguez, and while the conversation was pitched as a deep-dive into creativity, I couldn't help but feel like they were speaking from a time capsule—circa 2005, maybe. Their focus on procrastination, writer’s block, and the need to “just do the work” is not only outdated, it's irrelevant to the actual crisis facing creators today.</p>
  
    <p>The world they’re describing—the tortured artist struggling to get started—belongs to a different era. We’re not lacking <em>art</em>. We’re drowning in it. Never in history has there been such an overabundance of creative output: images, music, videos, writing—millions of pieces generated daily, many with the aid of AI. The tools are accessible. The barriers to entry have crumbled. Anyone with a prompt can generate something that <em>looks</em> like art. That’s not the problem.</p>
  
    <p>The problem is curation. The problem is saturation. The problem is visibility in a world where quality doesn’t guarantee discovery. Great work sits beside algorithmic trash. Visionary artists are indistinguishable from visual noise. This is not a battle of procrastination. It’s a war of relevance.</p>
  
    <p>Rodriguez, for all his talent, speaks from a rarefied position. Being a director with full creative autonomy is as uncommon as being an astronaut or Formula 1 driver. That experience doesn't generalize to the reality most artists face today: a system where originality has no structural support, and where attention—not quality—determines success.</p>
  
    <p>And Rogan, for all his reach, is no Carlin or Hicks. He holds a platform built on volume, not nuance. His comedy lacks depth, yet he commands an audience of millions. Meanwhile, countless original thinkers and artists are buried under the noise—because they’re not loud, they're not outrageous, or they’re simply too sophisticated for the scroll culture we’ve built.</p>
  
    <p>We're not in an age where people are “afraid” to create. We’re in an age where everyone already <em>is</em> creating. The question is: what now? How do you <em>elevate</em> the signal above the noise? How do you protect artistic value when even the worst content is given equal visual space? How do you establish meaning in a culture that rewards virality over substance?</p>
  
    <p>That’s the conversation I wish they'd had. That’s the conversation we need.</p>
  
    <p>Because if we don’t find new frameworks for curation, discernment, and distribution, we’ll continue to confuse visibility with value—and leave the best voices unheard in a world louder than ever.</p>
