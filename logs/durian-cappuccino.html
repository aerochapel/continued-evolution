  <blockquote><em>"Some experiences cannot be bottled, packaged, or replicated—they can only be lived fully."</em></blockquote>

  <p>There are few fruits in the world as misunderstood, as celebrated, and as divisive as durian. Known widely as the "King of Fruits," durian is not simply unique because of its flavor—it is an experience, an entire ecosystem of sensations that challenge the very idea of what eating fruit should feel like.</p>

  <p>Visually, durian is visceral. Its exterior is sharp, almost menacing, with thorny spikes that demand respect and caution. It's not something you casually pick up and bite into; accessing a durian requires a practiced method—cutting along its natural seams to reach the treasure hidden inside. And what you find is striking: a creamy, delicate flesh, soft and rich, the complete antithesis of its harsh exterior. It's a fruit that teaches patience, precision, and care before it even touches your tongue.</p>

  <p>Then, there's the smell—a phenomenon in itself. So potent that durian is banned from hotels, airports, and public transport in much of Southeast Asia. It carries an intensity that only a few other foods, like Indonesian bitter beans, can even approach. That a fruit's smell is so powerful it needs legal containment already speaks volumes about its character.</p>

  <p>But the uniqueness of durian goes even deeper. It isn't an everyday fruit like bananas or apples. Durian has a season—a fleeting moment where it arrives in all its glory, creating a kind of cultural phenomenon: roadside stalls bloom overnight, and people queue for hours to get the best harvests. And unlike most fruits, where different varieties might blur together, durian offers dramatic distinctions between types—Musang King, Black Thorn, D24, Red Prawn—each with unique taste, texture, density, and color. Even newcomers can detect the difference, much like a novice wine drinker can tell apart a deep red from a light white, even if they don't yet have the words.</p>

  <p>Durian is not just consumed; it is <em>experienced</em>. Its richness, its story, its moment-in-time rarity, and its unapologetic character make it almost sacred to those who truly understand it.</p>

  <p>And that experience comes with responsibility, too. In Southeast Asia, there’s a common warning: do not mix durian and alcohol. Consuming both can be dangerous, even fatal, because durian’s complex chemical composition can interfere with the body's ability to process alcohol. Eating durian demands mindfulness—not just during the act itself, but before and after. It forces you to consider what you’ve consumed earlier, or what you plan to consume later. In a way, durian teaches an indirect discipline: you cannot be careless with it. Its high cost, its overpowering smell, its demanding preparation—all of it creates a kind of monumental gravity around the act of eating it. You don't just eat durian. You <em>commit</em> to it.</p>

  <p>Which brings me to the durian cappuccino.</p>

  <p>Recently in Ho Chi Minh City, I stumbled across a shop selling durian cappuccinos. Curious, but skeptical, I gave it a try. It was exactly what I feared: a hollow experience. The drink had the vague sugary note of durian, but none of its soul. It felt artificially sweet, stripped of the complexity, robbed of the primal awe that comes with cracking open a fresh durian and diving into its golden flesh.</p>

  <p>The durian cappuccino experience made me think about what happens when something singular and profound gets extracted, diluted, and commercialized. When we take a complex, deeply contextual thing and try to make it easily consumable, we lose the very essence that made it special.</p>

  <p>And this isn't just a story about fruit. It mirrors what's happening across society. Social media has multiplied the channels through which we connect and communicate, but instead of deepening our understanding, it has often stripped human beings, ideas, and even truths of their complexities. Politicians become caricatures. Cultural practices become memes. Individuals become brands. Like the durian cappuccino, the surface remains, but the depth—the struggles, the contradictions, the soul—gets lost.</p>

  <p>We live in an era of infinite access, but paradoxically, we are further from understanding. More ways to "taste" something, but fewer opportunities to actually <em>experience</em> it. More information, but less wisdom.</p>

  <p>Durian teaches a different lesson. It demands you slow down. To brave its thorns, to tolerate its smell, to submit to its seasonality, to taste its richness in full. It asks for context, for patience, for respect—for responsibility.</p>

  <p>The durian cappuccino is, in its own way, a quiet reminder: if we want to truly understand people—or anything of depth—we have to go out of our way. We have to move beyond the surface, beyond the first impression, and make the effort to encounter the full, complicated, sometimes overwhelming truth. There’s a responsibility in that too. Because the further we stray from the essence, the more hollow, the more inauthentic, everything becomes.</p>

  <p>So next time you’re tempted by a shortcut, by a sweet, easy version of something profound, resist. Go to your local market. Pick up a real durian. Run your fingers carefully along its spikes. Cut into it with patience. Smell it in all its intensity. Taste it in all its raw glory.</p>

  <p>Experience it for what it is—and be reminded that some things cannot, and should not, be diluted.</p>

  <p>Because no imitation can replace the essence.</p>

  <p>And maybe that's why durian is my favorite fruit. It reminds me to appreciate the complexity, the context, and the depth that always surround anything truly worthwhile. It's a reminder to look beyond the surface—and to embrace the full, imperfect, beautiful reality of things as they truly are.</p>
