            <p>After more than a decade abroad, approaching 15 years, I began to question the validity of my nationality and my sense of belonging. Having lived away from my home country, far from the Western civilization I grew up in, I found myself detached from the cultural systems that once defined me. The longer I stayed away, the more I realized I no longer identified with the nationality I was born into.</p><p>Growing up in the United Kingdom, I always felt somewhat alien in my own country. Despite its historical roots in Christian principles, I rarely saw evidence of those values in the society around me. Whether in the way people lived, how the country was governed, or the cultural norms I was expected to adhere to, I felt misaligned. My principles seemed at odds with the environment, creating a subtle but persistent sense of displacement.</p><p>This feeling only deepened when I moved abroad. Living in countries like Japan, I experienced an unexpected paradox: I felt more connected there than I ever had in the UK. What I imagined Japan to be before arriving aligned closely with my lived experience, fostering a sense of belonging I had never felt at home. This contrast intensified my questioning of nationality itself. If I could feel more at home in a foreign land than in the country of my birth, what did nationality really mean?</p><p>The more I reflected, the more I realized that nationality is, at best, a superficial marker. It attempts to define us based on arbitrary borders and cultural traits, but it says little about the deeper aspects of identity—our principles, our purpose, and our true sense of belonging. Living abroad revealed to me that while we might apply ourselves to the nation we are from, our ultimate citizenship is not tied to this world.</p><h3 id="universal-citizenship">Universal Citizenship</h3><p>Through this journey, I came to understand that our true identity transcends the nations we inhabit. We are, in a sense, citizens of the world. But even this realization felt incomplete. It wasn’t until I found Christ that I truly understood where my ultimate citizenship lies.</p><p>In Christ, I found a new sense of belonging—a citizenship not of this earth but of Heaven. As the Apostle Paul writes:</p><p><strong>"But our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ."</strong> <em>(Philippians 3:20)</em></p><p>This understanding gave me a profound sense of clarity and peace. While I had felt lost, questioning my identity and nationality, I realized that my true identity is rooted in Christ. It is a citizenship that transcends earthly systems, cultural divisions, and the fleeting nature of patriotism.</p><h3 id="the-tension-between-principles-and-nationality">The Tension Between Principles and Nationality</h3><p>That said, I also recognize the importance of maintaining certain foundational principles within society. Conservative structures, for example, provide stability and cohesion. They create the frameworks that allow communities to function harmoniously. Without these foundations, society risks becoming fragmented, overwhelmed by subdivisions of conflicting ideologies and values.</p><p>However, while these structures are important, they should not define us. Nationality, when taken too far, fosters division. It creates an "us vs. them" mentality that undermines the universal truth of our shared humanity. True belonging cannot be found in systems designed by man; it can only be found in the eternal, unchanging truth of Christ.</p><h3 id="finding-identity-in-christ">Finding Identity in Christ</h3><p>What I’ve learned through this journey is that identity is not determined by where we are born or the culture we inherit. It is determined by the principles we live by and, ultimately, by our relationship with Christ.</p><p>When I moved abroad, people often assumed I embodied the stereotypes of UK culture. Yet my values, worldview, and demeanor often reflected the opposite. This disconnect between external perception and internal reality only deepened my understanding that nationality does not constitute identity.</p><p>It is through Christ that we discover who we truly are. And once we find that essence—our identity in Him—it becomes our responsibility to express it to the world. Whether through creative pursuits, acts of kindness, or simply living authentically, we are called to reflect the purity of His perfection. In doing so, we communicate a truth that is unfiltered by the distortions of human systems.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>After years of questioning my identity, I’ve come to understand that my nationality does not define me. Nor does it define anyone. Our true citizenship lies beyond this world, in the eternal kingdom of Christ. This is the most sustainable, unshakable form of identity.</p><p>As Christians, we are called to live out this truth—to find our essence in Christ and to express it in a way that transcends borders, systems, and divisions. By doing so, we reflect the unchanging perfection of His love and truth to a world in need of unity and hope.</p>
