            <p>Stephen Colbert’s criticism of Tulsi Gabbard reveals a troubling cultural trend in the U.S., where talk show hosts increasingly follow the mainstream news narrative, no matter where it leads. Despite Gabbard’s distinguished record—serving in combat, advocating for a pragmatic foreign policy, and dedicating herself to addressing the destructive consequences of war—Colbert quickly dismissed her intelligence after learning she was being considered by Trump for Director of National Intelligence in his 2025 cabinet. This shift is especially striking given their respectful interactions on his show back in 2019.</p><p>Colbert's insults, calling her a “MAGA minion” and “Cruella de Village Idiot,” reflect not just immaturity but the troubling way in which mainstream media narratives now infiltrate late-night talk shows, effectively thought-policing the public before they head off to bed. This is especially shocking considering Colbert, a dramatic actor, would not stand a chance on a battlefield. He is just another mouthpiece echoing the narrative that anyone advocating for peace is either an ally or a Russian spy. In contrast, Gabbard was deployed to Iraq as a combat medic, a crucial role supporting soldiers who risked their lives for their country. One only has to look at her patriotic service to see that her actions speak far louder than anything an entertainer like Colbert might say.</p><p>It is interesting that much of the support for the Democratic Party comes from people who spend more time acting as heroes on screen than actually serving their country. As I get older, I realize how much my grandfathers did for my own country, England, and how media brainwashing has led us to apologize for our assertive role during that time. Meanwhile, the threat of nuclear war—something too easily dismissed by many—remains an unfathomable danger that could send humanity back to the Stone Age. We’ve become so desensitized by constant news cycles that we’ve forgotten the true consequences of such a catastrophe. Films like Nolan’s <em>Oppenheimer</em> miss the mark by failing to depict the full destructive capacity of nuclear weapons and their devastating effects on the Japanese people. It is these consequences, the scars left on those who survived the atomic bomb and the brave “atomic soldiers” who witnessed nuclear tests, that should never be forgotten.</p><p>Our culture, now shaped by fleeting news reports and sensational headlines, has become numb to the harsh realities of war and history. Colbert’s dismissive attitude toward those who have real, lived experience of war is emblematic of a broader issue in our society: entertainers insulated from the consequences of global conflict shaping public opinion. Instead of theorizing, I suggest watching “Tulsi Gabbard’s Emotional Speech” on YouTube. If you can’t connect with the depth and sincerity of her words, I don’t know what else to say. At some point, you have to engage with what your fellow humans are trying to express, not just laugh at some late-night joke.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvWhKGfpcaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Tulsi Gabbard's Emotional Speech"></iframe></figure><p>In China, Colbert’s behavior exemplifies the term “Baizuo,” a Chinese expression used to mock those who undermine their own culture for ideological conformity. While countries like China unapologetically celebrate their history and progress, much of the West seems intent on unraveling its own foundations. We forget that our freedoms were hard-won and can easily be lost if incompetence and wokism prevail as the default mode of reality. We’ve become so detached from our own successes that we now view them as liabilities rather than achievements.</p><p>The mainstream left’s ideas about how other countries perceive the U.S. or the UK are increasingly out of touch. The belief that we can Frankenstein capitalism and Christianity to fit every culture is misguided and unsustainable. Having lived in several cultures, I’ve come to realize that national identity is something people value deeply, often without even realizing it. Countries like Japan, with their strong and distinct cultural identity, are thriving because they offer an authentic experience—something Europe, increasingly homogenized by globalization, no longer provides.</p><p>Conservative outlooks in the Middle East and Asia reject many of the progressive agendas being pushed in the West. These countries are not afraid to admit that the integration of progressive ideals into their societies is not easy. It’s like trying to install Microsoft Paint on a MacBook. The world outside the West’s ultra-progressive ideals is not in unison with them. People in these regions respect the West for being itself—not for constantly apologizing for its history. Baizuo truly defines this shift: while China builds on its past, we in the West tear ours apart.</p><p>Tulsi Gabbard’s leadership, grounded in real experience and a belief in America’s potential, is a reminder of what real strength looks like. It’s an echo of the strength that built the landscape of freedom we now enjoy—freedom fought for by our fathers and grandfathers. We must reclaim that strength before we lose sight of it entirely, distracted by entertainers who copy and paste rhetoric that leads to dire consequences.</p>
