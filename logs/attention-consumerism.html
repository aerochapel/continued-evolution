            <p>Recently, a friend sent me a video of a Christian testimony they described as “amazing.” The video featured a man with tattoos all over his face, passionately sharing how he found Christ. However, it was edited with constant jump cuts, dramatic effects, and a pacing that felt more like an ad for dishwasher tablets than a heartfelt testimony. While the message might have been genuine, the delivery was so heavily commercialized that it was hard to connect with. Instead of drawing me in, it left me wondering: why are we packaging something as profound as faith in such an artificial way?</p><p>This experience made me reflect on the state of our digital culture, where attention has become the ultimate currency. We’re no longer merely consuming products; we’re consuming people—their time, energy, and focus. In turn, creators are engaging in what can only be described as digital cannibalism: using exaggerated, flashy tactics to extract attention from others and elevate their own metrics. This obsession with attention is transforming the way we create and interact, moving us further from authenticity and deeper into a machine-driven reality.</p><h3 id="consuming-humans-instead-of-products">Consuming Humans Instead of Products</h3><p>The World Economic Forum famously claimed, “You’ll own nothing, and you’ll be happy.” While this statement was originally about material possessions, it reflects a deeper societal shift. As physical ownership diminishes, we are shifting to a different kind of consumerism: the consumption of attention. Social media platforms thrive on this, encouraging us to treat human interactions as commodities.</p><p>In this digital landscape, followers, likes, and views are the new currency, turning people into metrics. Ironically, many who seek attention through these metrics wouldn’t even acknowledge their “followers” in real life. This paradox creates a warped sense of connection, where people value numbers over genuine relationships. It’s a system designed to feed narcissism while eroding empathy and real community.</p><h3 id="a-machine-driven-reality">A Machine-Driven Reality</h3><p>What’s particularly troubling is how this behavior is normalizing machine-like tendencies in human interactions. Algorithms encourage us to mimic AI-driven content—quick, flashy, and formulaic. The result is a blurring of the line between human and machine-generated creations. In a bid to remain relevant, creators are abandoning authenticity and embracing the very traits that make their work indistinguishable from synthetic content.</p><p>As Christians, we have a responsibility to counteract this trend. Our work should highlight the traits that machines can never replicate: humility, imperfection, and a deep connection to truth. By creating with these values, we can set a standard that distinguishes human content from the endless noise of algorithms and AI.</p><h3 id="generations-raised-in-the-machine">Generations Raised in the Machine</h3><p>Every subsequent generation born into this machine-driven culture faces an even greater challenge. If digital cannibalism continues unchecked, future generations will see this attention-driven behavior as normal. They’ll grow up treating human worth as a metric, disconnected from the intrinsic value of people as God’s creation.</p><p>This lack of human-centered interaction is already contributing to widespread issues like anxiety, depression, and social disconnection. When people are raised in systems that prioritize metrics over meaning, they lose their ability to navigate life as relational beings. They become trapped in a cycle of seeking validation from others while struggling with their own sense of worth.</p><h3 id="the-danger-of-attention-seeking">The Danger of Attention-Seeking</h3><p>The Bible warns us about the dangers of seeking validation from the world rather than from God. In John 12:43, it says:<br><strong>“For they loved human praise more than praise from God.”</strong></p><p>This verse encapsulates the heart of the issue. Attention-seeking is rooted in a desire for worldly approval, but it ultimately distracts us from our higher purpose: to glorify God. When we prioritize human praise, we lose sight of eternal truths and align ourselves with fleeting, superficial values.</p><h3 id="a-responsibility-to-be-human">A Responsibility to Be Human</h3><p>As Christians, we must actively distinguish ourselves from this machine-driven culture. Our creations should reflect our humanity—our humility, empathy, and connection to Christ. By doing so, we not only honor God but also remind the world of the beauty of being human. The more we create content that emphasizes these qualities, the more we normalize authenticity and counteract the synthetic tendencies of our time.</p><p>This responsibility extends to how we engage with digital tools. While algorithms push us toward sensationalism, we must resist the temptation to conform. Instead, we should focus on creating content that aligns with our values and reflects the truth of who we are in Christ.</p><h3 id="a-sustainable-path-forward">A Sustainable Path Forward</h3><p>The current model of content creation is not sustainable. Chasing metrics leads to burnout, anxiety, and a loss of identity. If we continue to build a world where human worth is measured by likes and views, we risk creating a society devoid of empathy and connection.</p><p>This is why following Christ’s pace is so important. His teachings emphasize humility, patience, and authenticity. By aligning ourselves with His principles, we create a sustainable rhythm of life that prioritizes meaning over metrics. In the long run, this approach leads to work we can be proud of—work that reflects our true selves rather than a distorted image crafted to fit into a broken system.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Attention consumerism thrives on our desire for validation, turning human connection into a commodity. But as Christians, our north star is Christ. He is the ultimate validator of our work and our lives. When we root our creations in Him, we don’t need to seek approval through inflated metrics or exaggerated content. Instead, we can focus on creating with humility, integrity, and purpose.</p><p>Let us reject the machine-driven culture of attention-seeking and instead embrace our God-given ability to create with authenticity. In doing so, we not only honor our Creator but also inspire others to see the distinction between the synthetic and the spiritual, the fleeting and the eternal.</p>
