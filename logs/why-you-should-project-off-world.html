            <p>The 2024 U.S. election revealed a fascinating and troubling tendency in human behavior: projection. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, along with their supporters, engaged in a pattern of blaming others for the very things they themselves were accused of. This wasn’t merely a political strategy—it reflected a deeper cultural issue: the refusal to confront one’s own failings. Instead of acknowledging guilt and addressing mistakes, they displaced their flaws onto others, keeping the cycle of blame alive.</p><p>One candidate’s accusations were carefully choreographed and amplified by the majority of the media, aligning with dominant narratives to give their claims a sense of legitimacy. In contrast, the other candidate’s projections were framed negatively and given little support, promoted by only a small minority of media outlets. This dynamic wasn’t accidental—it was a calculated use of perception. Politicians and their media allies know that most people, preoccupied with daily life, don’t have the time to analyze these narratives deeply. By taking advantage of this, they ensure their projections shape public opinion, regardless of the truth.</p><p>But projection doesn’t resolve problems—it recycles them. Blaming someone else for your own faults keeps the weight of those issues firmly rooted in the world. This not only perpetuates the problem but also teaches future generations that deflecting guilt is an acceptable way to handle wrongdoing.</p><h3 id="migration-vs-recycling">Migration vs. Recycling</h3><p>When we acknowledge our sins and repent, it’s like migrating data off-world. The weight of our mistakes, guilt, and failures is lifted—not only from ourselves but from the world. Repentance allows us to offload those burdens to Christ, who eradicates them entirely. This act doesn’t just transform the individual; it removes the sin from the cycle of human brokenness, freeing the world from its weight.</p><p>Projection does the opposite. Instead of confronting mistakes, it displaces them onto others, keeping the problem alive. Blame becomes a form of recycling—a way to repackage the same issues without ever addressing their root cause.</p><h3 id="the-pattern-of-projection">The Pattern of Projection</h3><p>Projection is not just a political tactic—it’s a defense mechanism that avoids accountability. By shifting blame, individuals convince themselves and others of their innocence, but this comes at the cost of personal and relational integrity.</p><p>Jesus warns against this behavior in Matthew 7:3-5:<br><strong>"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"</strong></p><p>This teaching reminds us that transformation begins with self-examination. Blame-shifting only deepens the problem, locking both the individual and the world in a perpetual cycle of unresolved conflict.</p><p>Breaking the Cycle</p><p>The solution is not projection—it’s migration. When we recognize our sins, the answer is not to displace them onto others but to surrender them to Christ. True freedom comes from acknowledging our guilt and trusting Him to carry it.</p><p>As Psalm 103:12 reminds us:<br><strong>"As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us."</strong></p><p>Repentance is not just about personal transformation—it’s about removing the weight of sin from the world. Blame keeps problems grounded; repentance removes them entirely.</p><h3 id="a-call-to-responsibility">A Call to Responsibility</h3><p>What we witnessed during the election reflects a broader societal issue. Blame-shifting may win short-term political points, but it leaves deeper wounds unhealed. As individuals, we are called to model a better way.</p><p>Acknowledging our faults and seeking repentance isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s a path to freedom. When we transfer our guilt to Christ, it isn’t recycled—it’s eradicated. This act of surrender not only restores us but also teaches others the value of accountability and grace.</p><p>Let us break the cycle of projection. Instead of keeping our sins within the world, let us project them off-world to the One who can truly erase them. Only then can we experience genuine renewal and reflect His grace to others.</p>
