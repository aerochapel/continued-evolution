  <p>On Saturday, April 26th, 2025, I watched the funeral of Pope Francis, broadcast live from St. Peter’s Basilica. It was a solemn and historic occasion, yet one detail stood out above all: the sea of phones raised in the air, recording. As the casket of the Pope—an open casket—passed by, the crowd, rather than mourning or reflecting, was desperate to document the moment. Arms jutted into the air, each trying to get a better shot than the person next to them, not for the sake of art or history, but simply to say they had captured it.</p>

  <p>This observation led me to think more deeply about the state of our world, and how warped our understanding of "being present" has become. These people came to the Vatican presumably because they felt this moment was important. They wanted to live through it. Yet ironically, by choosing to experience it through a six-inch screen, they severed themselves from the reality unfolding in front of them. They attended in body, but not in mind.</p>

  <p>There is no shortage of documentation of such events. High-quality 4K footage from every possible angle, drone shots, artistic photography, and written accounts all ensure that moments like these are immortalized with far greater skill and clarity than any smartphone can provide. Despite this, individuals feel an urgent personal responsibility to capture their own blurry, redundant version, as if without their personal video, the moment would somehow vanish.</p>

  <p>The funeral, like any funeral, is meant to be a space for mourning, for silence, for reflection. These are things that demand presence. You cannot truly mourn someone while simultaneously trying to frame a video shot. You cannot reflect while directing your mind toward capturing a moment for future likes, shares, or even personal review. When a cinematographer looks through a camera, they are thinking about the shot, not the experience. Their mind is focused on framing, lighting, narrative—on everything except direct participation. It is a second-hand experience by design.</p>

  <p>Looking at the stunning architecture of St. Peter’s Basilica, the weight of history it holds, the artistry it embodies, I thought about how extraordinary it must be simply to stand there—to feel the vastness of time and human devotion pressing down in stone and marble. Yet many preferred instead to view this through a tiny glass rectangle, obsessed not with seeing but with recording.</p>

  <p>This raises another uncomfortable truth: attendance does not equate to connection. Just showing up at a funeral does not validate your relationship to the deceased. It does not automatically make your presence meaningful. I know this firsthand. When my grandfather died during the pandemic, I watched his funeral via a live stream. I was not there physically, but for years before his death, I spoke to him every week for hours, discussing everything under the sun. The depth of that connection was not lessened by my absence at his funeral. Meanwhile, there were people physically present who had hardly spoken to him when he was alive.</p>

  <p>The same applies at events like the Pope’s funeral. Many who cared deeply for him, or whose lives were touched profoundly by his work, were not there—either due to health, distance, or circumstance. Meanwhile, many who were there treated it more as an opportunity for social media fodder than for reverence. The people who truly understand what it means to honor the dead are not necessarily the ones who manage to show up in person.</p>

  <p>And disturbingly, nobody on the televised broadcast even commented on this. It was as if the ocean of phones was invisible, or worse, normal.</p>

  <p>Some artists have recognized this problem. The band TOOL, among others, bans phones from their concerts to force their audience to actually experience the music as it happens. It's telling that grown adults must now be forced into presence, that despite all our access to knowledge, wisdom, and insight, we still behave like distracted barbarians at sacred events meant for reflection.</p>

  <p>Phones themselves are not the enemy. Bring a phone if you need to stay in touch with loved ones, or for emergencies. But the behavior of standing with a selfie stick, shoving your device in front of others to broadcast yourself "experiencing" an event, is a form of narcissism. It makes the funeral about you, your perspective, your online presence—not about the deceased. The most absurd part is that everyone's footage will look the same: the same blurry casket, the same crowded basilica, the same angle, the same lighting. And all of it will be dumped into the vast landfill of meaningless content already clogging the internet.</p>

  <p>We don’t need more footage of things that are already exquisitely documented. We don’t need another shaky video of the Sydney Opera House. We don't need another thousand grainy videos of the Pope’s casket passing by. What we desperately need is a return to actual experience, to genuine reflection, to being where we are without trying to own the moment through our devices.</p>

  <p>We have to realize that we are not film directors, we are not brands, and we are not reporters. We are human beings—and human beings are made for experiences. Owning a phone does not automatically appoint us as curators of the world. We have been indoctrinated by social media to believe that everything must be captured, that every moment must be translated through a lens in order to matter. But true experience comes from being fully present—so present that the memories, the wisdom, and the internal transformation gained by living the moment outweigh any visual, verbal, or textual documentation. It is those invisible imprints—the ones absorbed so deeply they shape who we are—that truly live on.</p>

  <p>That is how experience manifests into character and growth. And this is why you can meet people who have traveled the world, collected endless photos and stories, and yet remain unchanged—while another person, who traveled only once but fully embraced it, is profoundly transformed by that single experience. The chance of such transformation happening while staring through a phone screen is almost zero.</p>
