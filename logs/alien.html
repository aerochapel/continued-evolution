            <p>When you become an expatriate—when you choose, or are compelled, to live in a land that is not your own—your relationship with time begins to shift. Before that moment, especially if you’re future-oriented, time feels expansive. Open. You imagine possibility. You sketch distant outcomes, place them on a horizon only you can see, and move toward them—not with certainty, but with momentum. The future is something you shape. Something you build into.</p><p>But when your presence in a country depends not on citizenship but on a visa or a work permit, time fractures. It stops being fluid and becomes segmented—measured not in years, but in permissions. Every expiration date becomes a checkpoint. One year. Two years. Five. Each interval a quiet reckoning. And with every renewal comes a strange sense of liberation, a reset. A reminder that your existence here is not guaranteed. It is conditional. Borrowed.</p><p>You begin to see the hourglass—not as metaphor, but as reality. Your time, quite literally, is ticking. And while you live under that weight, most people around you drift forward, unaware. They move through a world built on unspoken permanence. They don’t see the border beneath their feet, the silent contract that lets them belong without ever needing to ask.</p><p>Citizenship is invisible to those who have it. It is air. It is water. It is the background condition that makes everything else possible. To be an alien is to feel that absence in your bones. You live with heightened awareness—not just of where you are, but of how fragile that presence truly is.</p><p>That’s why I’ve come to believe that being a foreigner—truly being one—reshapes your understanding of belonging. You stop seeing home as a place, and start recognizing it as a right. The right to stay. To build. To speak freely without wondering if your words might cost you your place. That kind of belonging is a luxury. Most don’t even know they have it.</p><p>And it’s this tension, I think, that often gets overlooked—especially in countries like America. When politicians talk about borders, deportations, or national identity, the conversation is usually reduced to legality. But underneath that is a deeper message—not just to those trying to enter, but to those already inside: Value what you have. Don’t take it for granted.</p><p>When Trump says, “we’re throwing them out,” many—especially on the progressive left—hear only cruelty. And yes, the language is sharp, sometimes harsh. But others hear a deeper provocation—not just to migrants, but to citizens: This place matters. Don’t burn down the very freedom others are risking everything to touch. Whether we like him or not, Trump remains a reminder that citizenship is worth something. That America—and countries like it—are rare. And fragile.</p><p>Nations don’t decay simply because of the people arriving. They decay because of the entitlement of those already there—and because of leaders shaped by that same entitlement, who fail to grasp the complexity of integration. When people are allowed in without real systems of assimilation, without serious reflection on consequences, the result is often instability. And the citizens who most loudly demand open borders are often those who’ve never lived as foreigners. Never asked for permission to stay. Never had to prove their worth. Never lived conditionally.</p><p>That’s the blind spot of entitlement—it distorts not only how you treat your country, but how you treat those trying to enter it. It assumes freedom is infinite, culture is static, and systems can absorb anything without tension. But freedom, like time, has boundaries. And if you’ve never lived without it, you don’t know where those boundaries are.</p><p>That’s why I believe everyone should live—if only briefly—as a foreigner. Not for empathy. Not for enlightenment. But for humility. To know what it feels like to live on a fine edge. To realize your tomorrow depends on systems you don’t control. It won’t destroy you. It will refine you.</p><p>Being an expatriate gives you pressure, like gravity. It humbles you. It reminds you of your smallness—and your opportunity. It sharpens your sense of life. Like driving fast and suddenly realizing the road could end. So you grip the wheel tighter, and drive with intention.</p><p>So when I see people squander citizenship—weaponizing it, dismantling it, reducing it to a protest against a billionaire—I think: You don’t know what you have. You’ve been given a passport that millions would treasure, and all you see is the imperfection. Imagine if someone else had it—someone who’s lived on the other side. Someone who had to earn the right to stay. They would build something extraordinary.</p><p>That is the quiet dignity of the alien. It’s not just a legal label. It’s an existential condition—to live without entitlement, to see freedom not as a birthright but as a responsibility, and to act accordingly.</p>
