    <p>They can’t sit still.</p>
    <p>Wherever they go, the camera is already out. The thumbnail is already forming. They arrive not to experience, but to document. Not to listen, but to announce. Not to discover, but to <strong>devour</strong>.</p>
    <p>They digest places, cultures, and truths—then hollow them out. What’s left behind is a shell. A tabloid version of something once sacred. Another video, another clickbait title. Another headline like:<br><strong>“How to Eat Sushi While Hang Gliding Over a Kyoto Temple as a Tattooed Caucasian Female.”</strong></p>
    <p>These people are not observers. They are <strong>cultural parasites</strong>.<br>They feed on experience only to convert it into performance.<br>And when the performance is over, they move on to the next victim—the next country, the next trend, the next “truth” to flatten into a reel.</p>
    <p>And here’s the irony:<br>They claim to love experience—but they never <em>live</em> it.<br>They fear stillness. They avoid silence. They bypass solitude.<br>Every quiet moment is seen as wasted potential—something that could have been filmed, captioned, and uploaded. To them, <strong>meaning only exists if it's shareable</strong>.</p>
    <p>Everywhere they go becomes a mirror.<br>Every glance becomes a scan.<br>They don’t see the world as it is—they see it through a <strong>perpetual algorithmic filter</strong>.<br>A mental metal detector, constantly sweeping across landscapes, people, and moments—not searching for truth, but for <em>virality</em>.<br>It’s like stumbling across the remains of a lost civilization and asking, “Can this be sold on eBay by tonight?”</p>
    <p>This way of seeing is not natural.<br>It’s not human.<br>It detaches us from presence, from mystery, from soul.<br>It turns the world into an interactive brochure—valuable only when it can be filmed.</p>
    <p>We strap GoPros to handlebars.<br>We drone-shot sunrises.<br>We livestream emotions.<br>We live not in the moment—but in the <strong>recording of the moment</strong>.</p>
    <p>And young people are watching.<br>Not just watching—but <em>absorbing</em>.<br>Because they aren’t growing up with the wisdom of their parents or their communities.<br>They’re growing up with influencers.</p>
    <p>And those influencers aren’t teaching them how to think.<br>They’re teaching them how to extract.<br>How to build a brand.<br>How to turn every person, every place, every situation into <strong>inventory</strong> for attention.</p>
    <p>This didn’t start with social media.<br>If you trace the pattern closely, it leads back to the <strong>schoolyard</strong>.<br>That early ecosystem of status, noise, and hierarchy.<br>Where we learned to sort one another—not through understanding, but through performance.</p>
    <p>We thought we’d grow out of it.<br>We didn’t.<br>We just gave it cameras, Wi-Fi, and global reach.</p>
    <p>The schoolyard became the office.<br>The office became the feed.<br>And now we’re doing it to entire <em>nations</em>.</p>
    <p>We are categorizing cultures the way we once categorized classmates—sloppily, publicly, and without understanding.</p>
    <p>And the people doing it?<br>They’re not thinkers.<br>They’re not creators.<br>They’re just the loudest ones with a camera.</p>
    <p>They don’t create anything.<br>They react.<br>They slander.<br>They feed off the originality of others and stamp their name on it.<br>Their content isn’t content. It’s <strong>clout-harvesting</strong>.</p>
    <p>Because controversy is currency.<br>Performance is value.<br>And originality, if it exists at all, is buried under the noise.</p>
    <h3 id="even-reflection-has-been-hijacked">Even reflection has been hijacked</h3>
    <p>Take Michelle Obama. A woman of extraordinary access, now speaking publicly about the “hardships” of living in the White House. But those reflections don’t arrive in writing, or in stillness. They arrive through a branded podcast—produced, styled, and marketed. Her nails are perfect. Her jewelry sparkles. Her hair is camera-ready. And while her words describe discomfort, the image tells a different story: <em>polish, control, performance</em>. And the message? It doesn’t land.</p>
    <p>Because not everything needs to be shared.<br>Not every moment of discomfort is a podcast episode.<br>And in a world where people are truly struggling—financially, spiritually, emotionally—it doesn’t inspire. It distances.</p>
    <p>Even pain must now be <strong>content</strong>.<br>Even insight must come with a release schedule.<br>And even reflection, if it isn’t filmed, doesn’t seem to matter.</p>
    <p>But writing is different.<br>Writing invites stillness.<br>It allows ideas to breathe.<br>It detaches from the algorithm.<br>It gives the reader the dignity of <em>silence</em>.</p>
    <p>Video doesn’t do that.<br>Video is tied to the machine.<br>It is optimized. Monetized. Pushed.<br>It makes even sincerity feel like strategy.</p>
    <p>They took what was pure—like water—and saturated it with food dye.<br>Now it’s bright. Clickable. Hollow.<br>And we drink it like it’s still real.</p>
    <p>But it isn’t.</p>
    <p>We are not evolving.<br>We are imitating imitation.<br>We are documenting everything—yet understanding nothing.<br>We are rewarding the worst instincts, and letting the most sensitive, the most thoughtful, the most human voices disappear from view.</p>
    <p>We used to savor life.<br>Now we consume it like chicken nuggets—cheap, fast, and without memory.</p>
    <p>And in the end, we are left with a world that is fully captured—<br>But completely lost.</p>
