            <p>On April 14, 2025, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin launched another vanity rocket into suborbit. On board: a pop star, a morning show host, a billionaire’s wife, a former NASA engineer turned entrepreneur, a civil rights activist, and a fitness coach. The flight lasted 11 minutes. As the capsule returned to Earth, the passengers screamed in delight—high-pitched, performative, overwhelmed. It was a strange moment. Not reverence. Not reflection. Just noise. And it made one thing clear: these are not the people you send to confront the cosmos.</p><p>The media praised it. <em>Space is now inclusive</em>, they declared. But let’s be honest—space is not inclusive. It is not democratic, hospitable, or symbolic. It does not accommodate identity or income. It does not care who you are. It does not support oxygen. It is a realm of silence, danger, abstraction, and indifference. And yet we try to rebrand it, as if the void itself needs a marketing team.</p><p>This is the deeper problem with modern humanity: we no longer accept reality—we redesign it to match our narratives. Instead of asking what space is, we ask how it can be made more palatable to a focus group. We send entertainers and influencers into suborbit, and when they return, we’re handed empty phrases like <em>“I felt closer to love.”</em> No insight. No growth. Just slogans.</p><p>This isn’t exploration.<br>It’s branding.</p><p>And we’re not even branding it well. When celebrities start complaining about which other celebrities get to go to space first, it stops being a frontier and becomes a reality show—before we’ve even reached Mars. It's not a mission anymore. It’s just an episode.</p><p>I saw a glimpse of what space <em>used</em> to mean. In 2014, I was in South Korea when <em>Interstellar</em> came out. The reaction was profound. Families saw it as more than a movie—it was a spark. Something to get their kids thinking about science, time, and the survival of the species. South Korea, a place grounded in education and ambition, treated space seriously. Even <em>Ad Astra</em> in 2019, though different in tone, still respected the existential solitude space demands.</p><p>Compare that to now.</p><p>Now, we treat space like a backdrop. A place to be photographed in. It’s no different than how tourists treat Japan—travelers who show up in Tokyo because it's trending on TripAdvisor, but don’t know why they're there. They don’t understand the culture. They don’t want to. They just want the photo. The moment. The proof. Space will become that too. A luxury destination for the unimaginative.</p><p>And what’s worse is that we should know better. We have access to AI, to tools and knowledge that can simulate complex ideas, analyze abstract systems, answer questions people used to spend lifetimes wrestling with. But we don’t use it for that. We use it for captions. We use it for shortcuts. Despite having libraries of knowledge in our palms, we refuse to sit in the solitude required to understand anything real.</p><p>We don’t seek wisdom anymore. We seek attention.<br>We don’t want silence. We want soundbites.<br>We don’t want to explore. We want to be seen.</p><p>This wasn’t the democratization of space.<br>It was the commodification of awe.<br>And the ones who should be up there—the dreamers, the scientists, the kids who still stare upward with reverence—are watching it from below, while the influencers scream on re-entry.</p><p>And the truth is, none of this is surprising. It’s exactly what we should expect. We’re hurtling toward a world defined by vanity and empty symbolism. A civilization allergic to reflection, obsessed with performance. And when everything becomes this predictable, this hollow, you start to question whether there’s even a journey worth having within it.</p><p>Because what kind of life is left, when nothing surprises you anymore? When all the great possibilities—space, science, even selfhood—are flattened into content?</p><p>Sometimes it feels like the only real, authentic life left is the one lived far away from people. Away from the noise. From the trends. From the fake controversies and the plastic symbolism. Most people today lack imagination. They should never be anywhere near a rocket. They’re not going to bring back anything of value. They’re not going to further humanity. They’re just going to spend someone else’s money and return with a caption.</p><p>We could solve real problems on Earth with those resources. We could uplift people quietly, locally, intelligently. But we don’t want that. We want spectacle. Because we’ve forgotten that the purpose of being human is not just to act—but to <em>perceive</em>. To contribute insights. To add dimension. To deepen existence. And if we’re not doing that, we don’t deserve the launchpad.</p><p>It’s not about what we do.<br>It’s about <em>how</em> we do it.<br>And if we refuse to engage meaningfully with the few frontiers left—then we have no business being in the sky.</p><p>And that’s exactly what I’m going to do.<br>Live away from humanity, for the foreseeable future—until it begins to show even the most basic form of wisdom.</p>
