            <p>Object permanence, a term borrowed from psychology, describes the understanding that something continues to exist even when it is no longer visible. While this concept is often associated with childhood development, it resonates deeply with relationships and faith as we grow older. The ability to believe in something or someone despite their physical absence is not just a test of faith but also a profound gift—a spiritual exercise that strengthens bonds and illuminates the heart.</p><p>One of the most extraordinary examples of this in my life is my relationship with my friend Wesley. We haven’t seen one another since 2008, yet here we are in the year 2025, still deeply connected. Despite living in different parts of the world, we make an effort every day to interact, to check in, and to share pieces of our lives. Over time, this dedication has revealed something remarkable: Wesley knows me better than anyone else. This isn’t simply the result of familiarity but of the faith we’ve placed in one another.</p><p>This kind of connection, sustained across time and distance, is a spiritual gift—a reflection of Christ’s teaching. Jesus challenges us to believe in Him, even though He is unseen, and this faith becomes the foundation of our salvation. In John 20:29, Jesus says to Thomas, <strong>“Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”</strong> This is the heart of faith: trusting in what we cannot see, holding onto what transcends the physical.</p><h3 id="faith-in-the-unseen">Faith in the Unseen</h3><p>My relationship with Wesley has become an exercise in this kind of faith. The love, trust, and understanding we share endure not because we see each other every day but because we’ve placed our faith in the bond we share. It is a testament to the enduring nature of true friendship and a reflection of the spiritual truth that Christ teaches us.</p><p>Faith in the unseen—whether in a friendship, in a dream, or in Christ Himself—isn’t easy. It requires effort, intention, and a willingness to trust in what isn’t immediately tangible. Yet, it is in this trust that we find the deepest connections and the greatest spiritual growth. Christ calls us to believe in Him not only when we feel His presence but also when He feels distant. Similarly, true relationships are built not on proximity but on a dedication to nurture what truly matters.</p><h3 id="the-shallowness-of-modern-relationships">The Shallowness of Modern Relationships</h3><p>But here’s where I believe the world has gone astray. Relationships have been reduced to convenience and superficial exchanges, shaped by the way we communicate today. For example, I don’t use social media because I value real interactions. Even a video call—where you can see someone’s expressions and hear their voice—is infinitely more meaningful than scrolling through photos or comments.</p><p>When Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook, he unknowingly gave us a perfect metaphor for what modern communication has become: shallow, surface-level, and skin-deep. The very name "Facebook" captures this superficiality—it’s just a face, not a heart, not a soul, not the essence of who a person is.</p><p>Many people don’t want to truly know you; they just want to see you—to confirm your existence without delving deeper. Time spent with someone doesn’t always correlate with understanding them. You can see a person every day and not know their heart, their struggles, or their dreams. And if we approached Christ the same way, what would that say about our faith?</p><h3 id="superficial-faith-vs-deep-faith">Superficial Faith vs. Deep Faith</h3><p>Imagine if our faith in Christ were reduced to simply wanting to see a picture of Him—to demand proof of His existence before we could believe. Imagine if we treated faith like scrolling through a social media feed, briefly acknowledging His presence but never engaging with Him in a meaningful way.</p><p>Christ doesn’t want that. He doesn’t want our relationship with Him reduced to physical proof or mere appearances. He wants us to believe in Him even though He is unseen. He wants us to trust, to connect, and to have faith in the eternal and the profound—not the fleeting and the superficial.</p><h3 id="moving-toward-depth">Moving Toward Depth</h3><p>True faith, like true relationships, requires depth, dedication, and a willingness to see beyond the surface. It asks us to believe in what is unseen, to nurture what is meaningful, and to connect with what truly matters.</p><p>Whether it’s our relationship with Christ or the people we hold dear, let’s move away from the shallow and embrace the profound. Let’s value not just presence but essence. Because in the end, it’s the unseen—the heart, the soul, the faith—that truly endures.</p>
