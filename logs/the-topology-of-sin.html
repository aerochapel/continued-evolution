            <p>In 3D modeling, topology refers to the arrangement and structure of polygons that form a model’s surface. Clean topology is efficient, organized, and easy to work with, allowing for smooth adjustments and deformations. However, when the topology is messy or disorganized, the model becomes unnecessarily complex, harder to refine, and prone to errors. This complexity grows exponentially with each subdivision, adding more polygons—or poly count—which increases the size of the file and burdens the system running it.</p><p>If we think of the world as an operating system, our lives as individual models, and sin as the factor increasing our poly count, the connection becomes clear. The more we sin, the more complex we become, like a model with an unmanageable poly count. This excessive complexity slows down the operating system—our world—and contributes to the chaos and inefficiencies we see in reality today.</p><h3 id="sin-and-the-subdivision-of-complexity">Sin and the Subdivision of Complexity</h3><p>When we sin, it rarely stays isolated. Small cracks in our foundations—whether pride, greed, or selfishness—begin to branch out, subdividing into additional issues. Anxiety, depression, broken relationships, and societal unrest are like the messy topology of a poorly modeled 3D object. What starts as a single issue at the foundational level spirals into a web of interconnected problems.</p><p>At the foundational stage, these issues are manageable and easy to address. But as they go unacknowledged, they grow in complexity, creating additional layers of burden. Sin’s increasing poly count makes it harder to repair our lives, just as a 3D model with millions of unnecessary polygons becomes difficult to manage. And as more individuals carry the weight of their unchecked sin, the world—the operating system—slows down, bogged down by the inefficiency and heaviness of human brokenness.</p><h3 id="the-narrow-gate-vs-the-wide-gate">The Narrow Gate vs. The Wide Gate</h3><p>This principle echoes Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 7:13-14:<br><strong>"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."</strong></p><p>The narrow gate represents simplicity, focus, and addressing sin at its root. It is the path of repentance and humility, where we confront our mistakes before they multiply. The wide gate, by contrast, represents ignoring foundational issues, allowing them to branch into complexity. When we refuse to deal with sin, we widen the gate, adding more polygons to the model of our lives, making us increasingly unwieldy and harder to refine.</p><h3 id="the-problem-with-modern-solutions">The Problem with Modern Solutions</h3><p>In today’s world, we often attempt to treat symptoms rather than addressing the root causes. Mental health struggles like anxiety and depression, societal discord, and personal disconnection are subdivided into isolated issues rather than being seen as consequences of deeper spiritual fractures.</p><p>This symptom-based approach mirrors trying to fix a high-poly 3D model by tweaking its surface, ignoring the fact that the foundational geometry is flawed. The result? An increasingly complex and heavy system that becomes harder to manage.</p><p>The world’s solution is often to subdivide further—to add more tools, more distractions, more surface-level fixes. But this only increases the poly count, weighing down the operating system and creating additional complications.</p><h3 id="christ-as-the-foundation">Christ as the Foundation</h3><p>The only way to address the topology of sin is to return to the foundation. In 3D modeling, fixing the geometry at its base reduces complexity and restores simplicity. In life, the only true foundation is Christ.<br><strong>"For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ"</strong> (1 Corinthians 3:11).</p><p>When we bring our sins to Christ, He doesn’t just smooth over the surface—He rebuilds us from the inside out. Repentance through Him clears away the unnecessary complexity, simplifies our lives, and restores us to a state of spiritual efficiency. This is the narrow gate: dealing with sin early, addressing it at its root, and surrendering it to the One who can truly repair our brokenness.</p><h3 id="a-call-to-simplify">A Call to Simplify</h3><p>When we continue to live in sin, we add unnecessary weight to the world’s operating system. We burden ourselves and others with complexity that slows everything down. But through Christ, we can reduce our poly count, simplifying our lives and contributing to a healthier, more efficient world.</p><p>As Matthew 11:28 says:<br><strong>"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."</strong></p><p>This rest isn’t superficial; it’s foundational. Christ removes the weight of our sin, erases the chaos, and gives us the clarity to live with purpose.</p><h3 id="conclusion-build-clean-live-free">Conclusion: Build Clean, Live Free</h3><p>The topology of sin is a tangled mess that grows more unmanageable the longer it goes unaddressed. The more we sin, the more our poly count increases, creating complexity that weighs us down and slows the world around us.</p><p>But in Christ, there is a better way. He invites us to rebuild our lives on His foundation, to simplify, and to enter through the narrow gate. By addressing sin at its root and surrendering it to Him, we reduce the burden on ourselves and the world.</p><p><strong>"Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me"</strong> (Psalm 51:10).</p><p>Simplify your life. Reduce your poly count. Build your foundation on Christ.</p>
